Mutations in BRCA2 are thought to account for as much as 35% of all inherited breast cancer as wall as a proportion of inherited ovarian cancer. Many BRCA2-linked families also contain cases of male breast cancer. We have analysed germline DNA from 50 males with breast cancer (unselected for family history) and 26 individuals from site-specific female breast and breast-ovarian cancer families for mutations in BRCA2. All 17 breast-ovarian cancer families have been screened for BRCA1 coding region mutations and none were detected. Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analysis of PCR-amplified DNA followed by direct sequencing was used to detect sequence variants. Three of eleven individuals carry the same mutation, all are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, supporting the observation by Neuhausen et al. in this issue that there is a common mutation in this population. Eleven truncating mutations and nine polymorphisms were identified -- all were coding region variants. No loss-of-transcript mutations were identified in the sixteen samples for which this analysis was possible. Seven of the nine disease-associated mutations were detected in the 50 men with breast cancers; for thus in our series, BRCA2 mutations account for 14% of male breast cancer, all but one of which had a family history of male and/or female breast cancer."}

A combination of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations appears responsible for about 20%-30% of the cases with breast cancer familial history. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations largely varies within different populations; in particular, the rate of mutations in Italian breast and/or ovarian cancer families is rather controversial and ranges from 8% to 37%.\nOf the 152 breast/ovarian cancer families counseled in our centre, 99 were selected for BRCA1/2 mutation screening according to our minimal criteria. The entire coding sequences and each intron/exon boundary of BRCA1/2 genes were screened by direct sequencing (PTT limited to BRCA1 exon 11). For each proband, the a priori probability of carrying a pathogenic BRCA1/2 germline mutation was calculated by means of different mutation prediction models (BRCApro, IC and Myriad Table) in order to evaluate their performances.\nOur analysis resulted in the identification of 25 and 52 variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively. Seventeen of them represent novel variants, including four deleterious truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene (472insA, E33X, C1630X and IVS6+1G>C). Twenty-seven of the 99 probands harbored BRCA1 (n = 15) and BRCA2 (n = 12) pathogenic germline mutations, indicating an overall detection rate of 27.3% and increasing by more than 15% the spectrum of mutations in the Italian population. Furthermore, we found the lowest detection rate (19.4%) in pure hereditary breast cancer family subset. All of the prediction models showed praises and faults, with the IC software being extremely sensitive but poorly specific, compared to BRCApro. In particular all models accumulated most false-negative prediction in the HBC subset. Interestingly preliminary results of a study addressing the presence of genomic rearrangements in HBC probands with BRCApro or IC prediction scores >/=95%, provided evidence for additional mutations undetectable with our conventional screening for point mutations.\nAltogether our results suggest that HBC families, the largest pool in our series, represent an heterogeneous group where the apparently faulty performances of the prediction models might be at least partially explained by the presence of additional kinds of BRCA1/2 alteration (such as genomic rearrangements) or by mutations on different breast cancer related genes."}

In practice, however, several aspects of the guidelines lack specificity, are subject to varied interpretations, or fail to capture relevant aspects of clinical molecular genetics. A simple implementation of the guidelines in their current form is insufficient for consistent and comprehensive variant classification.MethodsWe undertook an iterative process of refining the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We used the guidelines to classify more than 40,000 clinically observed variants, assessed the outcome, and refined the classification criteria to capture exceptions and edge cases. During this process, the criteria evolved through eight major and minor revisions.ResultsOur implementation: (i) separated ambiguous ACMG-AMP criteria into a set of discrete but related rules with refined weights; (ii) grouped certain criteria to protect against the overcounting of conceptually related evidence; and (iii) replaced the \"clinical criteria\" style of the guidelines with additive, semiquantitative criteria.ConclusionSherloc builds on the strong framework of 33 rules established by the ACMG-AMP guidelines and introduces 108 detailed refinements, which support a more consistent and transparent approach to variant classification."}

To rapidly detect all possible changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the breast cancer genes, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. All exons of both genes are covered by the DGGE scan, comprising 120 amplicons. We use a semiautomated approach, amplifying all individual amplicons with the same PCR program, after which the amplicons are pooled. DGGE is performed using three slightly different gel conditions. Validation was performed using DNA samples with known sequence variants in 107 of the 120 amplicons; all variants were detected. This DGGE mutation scanning, in combination with a PCR test for two Dutch founder deletions in BRCA1 was then applied in 431 families in which 52 deleterious changes and 70 unclassified variants were found. Fifteen unclassified variants were not reported before. The system was easily adopted by five other laboratories, where in another 3,593 families both exons 11 were analyzed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and the remaining exons by DGGE. In total, a deleterious change (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site mutation, or large deletion) was found in 661 families (16.4%), 462 in BRCA1 (11.5%), 197 in BRCA2 (4.9%), and in two index cases a deleterious change in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 was identified. Eleven deleterious changes in BRCA1 and 36 in BRCA2 had not been reported before. In conclusion, this DGGE mutation screening method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is proven to be highly sensitive and is easy to adopt, which makes screening of large numbers of patients feasible. The results of screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in more than 4,000 families present a valuable overview of mutations in the Dutch population."}

Of these women, 969 were self-identified Jewish women. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate breast and ovarian cancer risks, as well as risk reduction from risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO), by CJM and self-identified Jewish status.\nNinety-one percent of Jewish BRCA1/2-positive women carried a CJM. Jewish women were significantly more likely to undergo RRSO than non-Jewish women (54% v 41%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.44 to 2.42). Relative risks of cancer varied by CJM, with the relative risk of breast cancer being significantly lower in 6174delT mutation carriers than in non-CJM BRCA2 carriers (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.69). No significant difference was seen in cancer risk reduction after RRSO among subgroups.\nConsistent with previous results, risks for breast and ovarian cancer varied by CJM in BRCA1/2 carriers. In particular, 6174delT carriers had a lower risk of breast cancer.

Due to the rarity of MBC, it is understudied and its etiology is poorly understood. Our objectives are to determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in MBC cases and to investigate the correlations between mutation status and cancer phenotypes. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer. The difference in BRCA2-mutation frequencies between cases with and without family history of breast cancer was not statistically significant (P = 0.145), suggesting that family history is not a strong predictor of carrying a mutation in males. We observed a highly significant association of carrying a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with high tumor grade (P < 0.001) and a weak association with positive lymph nodes (P < 0.02). Of the 97 BRCA2-negative MBC cases, we identified one PALB2 mutation with confirmed pathogenicity and one mutation predicted to be pathogenic, a prevalence of pathogenic PALB2-mutation of 1-2%. Based on our results and previous studies, genetic testing for BRCA2 should be recommended for any diagnosed MBC case, regardless of family history of breast cancer."}

The goal of this study is to identify whether African-American patients with breast cancer carry some common mutations reported in other ethnic groups and whether they carry some novel mutations. We screened hot-region mutations on exons 2, 5, 11, 16, and 20 of BRCA1 gene in 54 African-American patients with breast cancer by NIRCA and SSCP methods. Our data revealed one novel frameshift mutation (3331 insG) and three missense sequence variants (A3537G, A3667G, and C4009T) on exon 11. Each sequence change was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. One rare sequence variant, A3537G, has been revealed in high frequency (3/54). Our data suggested that African-American patients with breast cancer carry some unique BRCA1 gene mutations."}

As out-of-frame splicing defects lead to a marked reduction of the level of the mutant mRNA cleared through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cDNA-based test was developed to show the resulting allelic imbalance (AI). Fifty-four VUSs identified in 53 hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) patients without BRCA1/2 mutation were included in the study. Two frequent exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms on both BRCA1 and BRCA2 were investigated by using a semiquantitative single-nucleotide primer extension approach and the cDNA allelic ratios obtained were corrected using genomic DNA ratios from the same sample. A total of five samples showed AI. Subsequent transcript analyses ruled out the implication of VUS on AI and identified a deletion encompassing BRCA2 exons 12 and 13 in one sample. No sequence abnormality was found in the remaining four samples, suggesting implication of cis- or trans-acting factors in allelic expression regulation that might be disease causative in these HBOC patients. Overall, this study showed that AI screening is a simple way to detect deleterious splicing defects and that a major role for VUSs and deep intronic mutations in splicing anomalies is unlikely in BRCA1/2 genes. Methods to analyze gene expression and identify regulatory elements in BRCA1/2 are now needed to complement standard approaches to mutational analysis."}

BRCA2 was mapped to chromosomal 13q at about the same time (4). Just fifteen months later, Wooster et al. (5) reported a partial BRCA2 sequence and six mutations predicted to cause truncation of the BRCA2 protein. While these findings provide strong evidence that the identified gene corresponds to BRCA2, only two thirds of the coding sequence and 8 out of 27 exons were isolated and screened; consequently, several questions remained unanswered regarding the nature of BRCA2 and the frequency of mutations in 13q-linked families. We have now determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 (GenBank accession #U43746), and examined its pattern of expression.

We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 60-year-old carrier of a rare BRCA2 (1153insertionT) germline mutation. The patient received gemcitabine without any response and actually progression of the disease had occurred. Therefore cisplatin was added in combination with gemcitabine. A dramatic complete response to therapy was encountered with no evidence of disease in both CT scans and markers (CA19-9). In conclusion, in patients with known BRCA mutation associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin should be considered. Physicians should consider BRCA mutation testing when the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is established, especially when the patient belongs to an ethnic group where founder mutations exist, and/or there is strong personal or family history of cancer. This may be applied also to other metastatic tumors diagnosed in BRCA1/2 carriers."}

As an initial project of the ENIGMA Splicing Working Group, we report splicing and multifactorial likelihood analysis of 25 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants from seven different laboratories. Splicing analysis was performed by reverse transcriptase PCR or mini gene assay, and sequencing to identify aberrant transcripts. The findings were compared to bioinformatic predictions using four programs. The posterior probability of pathogenicity was estimated using multifactorial likelihood analysis, including co-occurrence with a deleterious mutation, segregation and/or report of family history. Abnormal splicing patterns expected to lead to a non-functional protein were observed for 7 variants (BRCA1 c.441+2T>A, c.4184_4185+2del, c.4357+1G>A, c.4987-2A>G, c.5074G>C, BRCA2 c.316+5G>A, and c.8754+3G>C). Combined interpretation of splicing and multifactorial analysis classified an initiation codon variant (BRCA2 c.3G>A) as likely pathogenic, uncertain clinical significance for 7 variants, and indicated low clinical significance or unlikely pathogenicity for another 10 variants. Bioinformatic tools predicted disruption of consensus donor or acceptor sites with high sensitivity, but cryptic site usage was predicted with low specificity, supporting the value of RNA-based assays. The findings also provide further evidence that clinical RNA-based assays should be extended from analysis of invariant dinucleotides to routinely include all variants located within the donor and acceptor consensus splicing sites. Importantly, this study demonstrates the added value of collaboration between laboratories, and across disciplines, to collate and interpret information from clinical testing laboratories to consolidate patient management."}

Still, a majority of HBC cases remain unexplained which is challenging for genetic counseling. We aimed to analyze additional mutations in HBC-associated genes and to define the sensitivity of our current BRCA1/2 mutation analysis protocol used in genetic counseling.\nEighty-two well-characterized, high-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals, were screened for germline alterations in seven breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, RAD50, and CDH1. BRCA1/2 were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing. CHEK2 was analyzed by the high resolution melt (HRM) method and PALB2, RAD50, BRIP1 and CDH1 were analyzed by direct sequencing. Carrier frequencies between 82 (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals and 384 healthy Finnish population controls were compared by using Fisher's exact test. In silico prediction for novel missense variants effects was carried out by using Pathogenic-Or-Not -Pipeline (PON-P).\nThree previously reported breast cancer-associated variants, BRCA1 c.5095C > T, CHEK2 c.470T > C, and CHEK2 c.1100delC, were observed in eleven (13.4%) individuals. Ten of these individuals (12.2%) had CHEK2 variants, c.470T > C and/or c.1100delC. Fourteen novel sequence alterations and nine individuals with more than one non-synonymous variant were identified. One of the novel variants, BRCA2 c.72A > T (Leu24Phe) was predicted to be likely pathogenic in silico. No large genomic rearrangements were detected in BRCA1/2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).\nIn this study, mutations in previously known breast cancer susceptibility genes can explain 13.4% of the analyzed high-risk BRCA1/2-negative HBOC individuals. CHEK2 mutations, c.470T > C and c.1100delC, make a considerable contribution (12.2%) to these high-risk individuals but further segregation analysis is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these mutations before applying them in clinical use. Additionally, we identified novel variants that warrant additional studies. Our current genetic testing protocol for 28 Finnish BRCA1/2-founder mutations and protein truncation test (PTT) of the largest exons is sensitive enough for clinical use as a primary screening tool."}

To this end, 71 breast and breast-ovarian cancer (HBC/HBOC) families along with 95 control individuals from a wide range of ethnicities were analyzed by means of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequence analysis. In the coding (10 257 bp) and non-coding (2799 bp) sequences of BRCA2, 82 sequence variants were identified. Three different, apparently disease-associated BRCA2 mutations were found in six HBC/HBOC families (8%): two splice site mutations in introns 5 and 21, and one frameshift mutation in exon 11. In the coding region, 53 simple sequence variants were found: 35 missense mutations, one 2 bp deletion (CT) resulting in a stop at codon 3364, one nonsense mutation with a stop at codon 3326, one deletion of a complete codon (AAA) resulting in the loss of leucine, and 15 silent mutations. In the non-coding region, 26 polymorphisms were detected. Of the 79 sequence variants that were not obviously disease-associated, eight were detected only in HBC/HBOC families. The remaining 71 variants were identified in both HBC/HBOC families and control individuals. Sixty three sequence variants (80%) were specific for a continent. Forty two percent (33 out of 79) of the sequence variants were detected exclusively in Africa, though only 13% of the 332 chromosomes screened were of African origin. Our data indicate that, in BRCA2, simple sequence variation is frequent [in the coding region 1 in 194 bp (straight theta = 2.2 x 10(-4)), and in the non-coding region 1 in 108 bp (straight theta = 4.4 x 10(-4)), respectively]."}

Treat.: 112(2), 343-9.", "authors": "Seymour IJ et al.", "pubmed_id": 18092194, "year": "2008", "abstract": "BRCA1/2 mutation status is of paramount importance to identify families at risk of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC). Most HBOC and BRCA1/2 mutation studies have focused on highly selected sub-populations, and few data are available for large population cohorts. For this reason, as part of a regional cancer prevention strategy in North-Central Italy, we set up a population-based screening programme to identify all resident HBOC families, and to determine their BRCA1/2 mutation status. To date, 44 different BRCA1/2 variants have been identified in 55 HBOC families. Of the seven newly reported mutations, only BRCA1 Q284X is clearly deleterious. The analysis of clinical disease characteristics in relation to age of disease onset and family history showed a difference between BRCA1/2 wild type and mutation carrier families. Interestingly, BRCA1/2 mutations were significantly more common in women who developed breast cancer <or=40 years of age than in BRCA1/2 wild type women (50% vs. 29%, respectively, P = 0.005). The family history selection criteria most likely to indicate the presence of deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations are breast cancer <or=35 years (P = 0.012), two first-degree relatives with breast cancer <or=50 years (P = 0.022), and male breast cancer (P = 0.047). The penetrance of BRCA1/2 alterations in our cohort seems to be aligned with other published results. However, new data interpretations have emerged in relation to the clinical criteria and the presence of deleterious mutations. This information shows that a correct and accurate clinical selection could avoid unnecessary molecular tests and could better address genetic analysis and clinical management."}

Sequencing-based genetic tests are now available to identify mutation carriers in an effort to reduce mortality through prevention and early diagnosis. However, lack of a suitable functional assay hinders the risk assessment of more than 1,900 BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in the Breast Cancer Information Core database that do not clearly disrupt the gene product. We have established a simple, versatile and reliable assay to test for the functional significance of mutations in BRCA2 using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and bacterial artificial chromosomes and have used it to classify 17 sequence variants. The assay is based on the ability of human BRCA2 to complement the loss of endogenous Brca2 in mouse ES cells. This technique may also serve as a paradigm for functional analysis of mutations found in other genes linked to human diseases."}

Mutat.: 34(11), 1547-57.", "authors": "Di Giacomo D et al.", "pubmed_id": 23983145, "year": "2013", "abstract": "Exonic variants can alter pre-mRNA splicing either by changing splice sites or by modifying splicing regulatory elements. Often these effects are difficult to predict and are only detected by performing RNA analyses. Here, we analyzed, in a minigene assay, 26 variants identified in the exon\u00a07 of BRCA2, a cancer predisposition gene. Our results revealed eight new exon skipping mutations in this exon: one directly altering the 5' splice site and seven affecting potential regulatory elements. This brings the number of splicing regulatory mutations detected in BRCA2 exon\u00a07 to a total of 11, a remarkably high number considering the total number of variants reported in this exon (n\u00a0=\u00a036), all tested in our minigene assay. We then exploited this large set of splicing data to test the predictive value of splicing regulator hexamers' scores recently established by Ke et al. (). Comparisons of hexamer-based predictions with our experimental data revealed high sensitivity in detecting variants that increased exon skipping, an important feature for prescreening variants before RNA analysis. In conclusion, hexamer scores represent a promising tool for predicting the biological consequences of exonic variants and may have important applications for the interpretation of variants detected by high-throughput sequencing."}

The frequency, spectrum and penetrance of mutant BRCA1/BRCA2 alleles have been determined for several populations, but little information is available for populations of African ancestry, who suffer a disproportionate burden of early onset breast cancer. We have performed complete sequence analysis of all BRCA1 and BRCA2 exons and intron-exon boundaries for 434 Nigerian breast cancer patients from the University College Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria. In contrast to previous suggestions that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation frequencies are low or undetectable in African American populations, we find that Nigerian breast cancer patients have an exceptionally high frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (7.1 and 3.9%, respectively). Sixteen different BRCA1 mutations were detected, seven of which have never been reported previously, while thirteen different BRCA2 mutations were seen, six of which were previously unreported. Thus, our data support enrichment for genetic risk factors in this relatively young cohort. To improve breast cancer outcomes, we suggest that family-based models of risk assessment and genetic counseling coupled with interventions to reduce breast cancer risk should be broadly disseminated in Nigeria and other underserved and understudied populations."}

One important way these VUS can have a functional impact is through their effects on RNA splicing. Here we present a custom RNA-Seq assay plus bioinformatics and biostatistics pipeline to analyse specifically alternative and abnormal splicing junctions in 11 targeted HBOC genes. Our pipeline identified 14 new alternative splices in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in addition to detecting the majority of known alternative spliced transcripts therein. We provide here the first global splicing pattern analysis for the other nine genes, which will enable a comprehensive interpretation of splicing defects caused by VUS in HBOC. Previously known splicing alterations were consistently detected, occasionally with a more complex splicing pattern than expected. We also found that splicing in the 11 genes is similar in blood and breast tissue, supporting the utility and simplicity of blood splicing assays. Our pipeline is ready to be integrated into standard molecular diagnosis for HBOC, but it could equally be adapted for an integrative analysis of any multigene disorder."}

We present the diagnostic application of EMMA (Enhanced Mismatch Mutation Analysis(\u00ae) , Fluigent, Paris, France), a novel method based on heteroduplex analysis by capillary electrophoresis using innovative matrices. BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened for point mutations and large rearrangements in 1,525 unrelated patients (372 for the validation step and 1,153 in routine diagnosis) using a single analytical condition. Seven working days were needed for complete BRCA1/2 screening in 30 patients by one technician (excluding DNA extraction and sequencing). A total of 137 mutations were found, including a BRCA2 duplication of exons 19 and 20, previously missed by Comprehensive BRACAnalysis(\u00ae) . The mutation detection rate was 11.9%, which is consistent with patient inclusions. This study therefore suggests that EMMA represents a valuable short-term and midterm option for many diagnostic laboratories looking for an easy, reliable, and affordable strategy, enabling fast and sensitive analysis for a large number of genes."}

Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine."}

The cumulative risk of breast cancer in female gene carriers was estimated to be 59.8% by age 50 years (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 25.9%-78.5%) and 79.5% by age 70 years (95% CI 28.9%-97.5%). The cumulative risk of breast cancer in male carriers was estimated to be 6.3% (95% CI 1.4%-25.6%) by age 70 years. There was no evidence of any risk difference between the two families. These results indicate that the lifetime breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers, for at least a subset of mutations, is comparable to that for BRCA1. A significant excess of ovarian cancer in gene carriers was observed (relative risk 17.69, based on three cases), but the absolute risk of ovarian cancer was less than that reported for BRCA1. Significant excesses of laryngeal cancer (relative risk 7.67, based on two possible carriers) and prostate cancer (relative risk 2.89, based on five possible carriers) were also observed. One case of ocular melanoma, as well as a second eye cancer of unspecified histology, occurred in obligate gene carriers."}

We identified 470 unique sequence variants, of which 113 were deleterious mutations. The remaining 357 VUS comprised 185 unique missense changes, 60% were observed only once, while 3% occurred with a frequency of >10%. Deleterious mutations occurred three times more often in women with CBC (15.3%) than in women with UBC (5.2%), whereas combined, VUS were observed in similar frequencies in women with CBC and UBC. A protein alignment algorithm defined 16 rare VUS, occurring at highly conserved residues and/or conferring a considerable biochemical difference, the majority located in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain. We confirm a multiplicity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUS that occur at a wide range of allele frequencies. Although some VUS inflict chemical differences at conserved residues, suggesting a deleterious effect, the majority are not associated with an increased risk of CBC."}
