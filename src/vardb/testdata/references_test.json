The subjects of this study were non-diabetic general population consisting of 2604 individuals >40 years in Takahata town, Japan. We genotyped 11 SNPs within NPHP4 gene that displayed frequent minor allele frequencies (>0.1) in Japanese general population. Among 11 SNPs in NPHP4 gene, only rs1287637 that induces amino acid substitution (A (Gln)/T (Leu)), located in the acceptor site of exon 21, showed a significant association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; T/T: 81.3\u00b115.6 (n=1886), A/T: 82.0\u00b115.5 (n=652) and A/A: 87.4\u00b121.4\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) per 1.73m(2) (n=66); mean\u00b1s.d., P=0.006). This SNP was not in linkage disequilibrium with the surrounding SNPs. The multivariate analysis adjusted with possible confounders showed that the A/T+T/T genotype of rs1287637 was independently associated with reduced renal function (eGFR <90\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) per 1.73m(2); odds ratio (OR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-2.94, P=0.033).

This study aimed to investigate the association of three polymorphisms of XPD at codons 156, 312, and 711, with the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.\nWe used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to genotype the three polymorphisms in 209 stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.\nThe variant homozygotes of XPD p.Arg(156)Arg (rs238406) polymorphism were associated with a significantly increased risk of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity (adjusted odds ratios, 3.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-7.78; P for trend = 0.009), and, more specifically, severe leukopenia toxicity (P for trend = 0.005). No statistically significant association was found for the three polymorphisms and grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Consistent with these results of single-locus analysis, both the haplotype and the diplotype analyses revealed a protective effect of the haplotype \"CG\" (in the order of p.Arg(156)Arg-p.Asp(312)Asn) on the risk of grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity.\nThis investigation, for the first time, provides suggestive evidence of an effect of XPD p.Arg(156)Arg polymorphism on severe toxicity variability among platinum-treated non-small cell lung cancer patients."}

The present meta-analysis of literatures was performed to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of Lys751Gln polymorphism and risk for two main types of EC: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A total of 12 studies were identified to the meta-analysis, including 2,575 cases (1,294 ESCC and 1,281 EADC) and 4,951 controls (1,891 ESCC and 3,060 EADC). Random-effects or fix-effects model was used according to between-study heterogeneity. The odds ratio (OR) for the variant homozygous genotype Gln/Gln of the Lys751Gln polymorphism, compared with the wild type homozygote Lys/Lys, was 1.26, with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.56, for EADC risk without between-study heterogeneity. When stratified by ethnicity, statistically significantly elevated risk was found among Chinese (Gln/Gln vs. Lys/Lys: OR 2.45, 95% CI = 1.10-5.44). However, no significant associations were found between XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism and EC risk when all studies pooled into the meta-analysis (Lys/Gln vs. Lys/Lys: OR 1.07, 95% CI = 0.88-1.28; Gln/Gln vs.us Lys/Lys: OR 1.25, 95% CI = 0.92-1.71; dominant model: OR 1.09, 95% CI = 0.90-1.33). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the Lys751Gln genetic polymorphism may be a potential biomarker of EC susceptibility in Chinese populations. And a study with the larger sample size is needed to further evaluate gene-environment interaction on XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism and EC risk."}

A subset of these polymorphisms displays an opposite risk profile in different autoimmune conditions. This observation open interesting questions on the evolutionary forces shaping the frequency of these alleles in human populations.We aimed at testing the hypothesis whereby balancing selection has shaped the frequency of opposite risk alleles.\nSince balancing selection signatures are expected to extend over short genomic portions, we focused our analyses on 11 regions carrying putative functional polymorphisms that may represent the disease variants (and the selection targets). No exceptional nucleotide diversity was observed for ZSCAN23, HLA-DMB, VARS2, PTPN22, BAT3, C6orf47, and IL10; summary statistics were consistent with evolutionary neutrality for these gene regions. Conversely, CDSN/PSORS1C1, TRIM10/TRIM40, BTNL2, and TAP2 showed extremely high nucleotide diversity and most tests rejected neutrality, suggesting the action of balancing selection. For TAP2 and BTNL2 these signatures are not secondary to linkage disequilibrium with HLA class II genes. Nonetheless, with the exception of variants in TRIM40 and CDSN, our data suggest that opposite risk SNPs are not selection targets but rather have accumulated as neutral variants.\nData herein indicate that balancing selection is common within the extended MHC region and involves several non-HLA loci. Yet, the evolutionary history of most SNPs with an opposite effect for autoimmune diseases is consistent with evolutionary neutrality. We suggest that variants with an opposite effect on autoimmune diseases should not be considered a distinct class of disease alleles from the evolutionary perspective and, in a few cases, the opposite effect on distinct diseases may derive from complex haplotype structures in regions with high genetic diversity."}

Several linkage and association studies have identified chromosomal regions and/or genes that affect alcohol consumption, notably in genes involved in the 2-stage pathway of alcohol metabolism.\nHere, we use multiple regression models to test for associations and interactions between 2 alcohol-related phenotypes and SNPs in 17 genes involved in alcohol metabolism in a sample of 1,588 European American subjects.\nThe strongest evidence for association after correcting for multiple testing was between rs1229984, a nonsynonymous coding SNP in ADH1B, and DSM-IV symptom count (p = 0.0003). This SNP was also associated with maximum number of drinks in 24 hours (p = 0.0004). Each minor allele at this SNP predicts 45% fewer DSM-IV symptoms and 18% fewer max drinks. Another SNP in a splice site in ALDH1A1 (rs8187974) showed evidence for association with both phenotypes as well (p = 0.02 and 0.004, respectively), but neither association was significant after accounting for multiple testing. Minor alleles at this SNP predict greater alcohol consumption. In addition, pairwise interactions were observed between SNPs in several genes (p = 0.00002).\nWe replicated the large effect of rs1229984 on alcohol behavior, and although not common (MAF = 4%), this polymorphism may be highly relevant from a public health perspective in European Americans. Another SNP, rs8187974, may also affect alcohol behavior but requires replication. Also, interactions between polymorphisms in genes involved in alcohol metabolism are likely determinants of the parameters that ultimately affect alcohol consumption."}

There is substantial epidemiological evidence supporting a genetic predisposition to diabetic nephropathy, however the exact molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Transforming growth factor (TGFbeta1) is a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.\nWe investigated the role of five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFB1 gene for their association with diabetic nephropathy in an Irish, type 1 diabetic case (n = 272) control (n = 367) collection. The activity of TGFbeta1 is facilitated by the action of type 1 and type 2 receptors, with both receptor genes (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) shown to be upregulated in diabetic kidney disease. We therefore screened TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes for genomic variants using WAVEtrade mark (dHPLC) technology and confirmed variants by direct capillary sequencing. Allele frequencies were determined in forty-eight healthy individuals. Data for all SNPs was assessed for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium, with genotypes and allele frequencies compared using the chi2 test for contingency tables. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium were established and common haplotypes estimated.\nFifteen variants were identified in these genes, seven of which are novel, and putatively functional SNPs were subsequently genotyped using TaqMantrade mark, Invadertrade mark or Pyrosequencing(R) technology. No significant differences (p > 0.1) were found in genotype or allele distributions between cases and controls for any of the SNPs assessed.\nOur results suggest common variants in TGFB1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes do not strongly influence genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in an Irish Caucasian population."}

These eight genes are apolipoprotein E (APOE), type I collagen alpha1 (COL1A1), estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha), leptin receptor (LEPR), parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor type 1 (PTHR1), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3), and vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (VDR). Yin yang haplotypes, two high-frequency haplotypes composed of completely mismatching SNP alleles, were examined. To quantify LD patterns, two common measures of LD, D' and r2, were calculated for the SNPs within the genes. The haplotype distribution varied in the different genes. Yin yang haplotypes were observed only in PTHR1 and UCP3. D' ranged from 0.020 to 1.000 with the average of 0.475, whereas the average r2 was 0.158 (ranging from 0.000 to 0.883). A decay of LD was observed as the intermarker distance increased, however, there was a great difference in LD characteristics of different genes or even in different regions within gene.\nThe differences in haplotype distributions and LD patterns among the genes underscore the importance of characterizing genomic regions of interest prior to association studies."}

We also identified 51 distinct polymorphisms and unclassified variants (three described for the first time).\nOur data suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of familial breast cancer in Moroccan patients. Therefore full BRCA1/2 screening should be offered to patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer."}

Among these proteins are the tissue-specific claudins, proteins that have recently been suggested as tumor markers for several different types of cancer. An altered claudin expression has been observed in colon, prostatic, ovarian, and breast carcinoma. The aim of this study was to analyze the allele frequencies of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes for claudin 1 and claudin 7 in colon cancer (CC) patients and in a control population of healthy blood donors. Pyrosequencing was used to genotype the CLDN1 SNP rs9869263 (c.369C>T), and the CLDN7 SNPs rs4562 (c.590C>T) and rs374400 (c.606T>G) in DNA from 102 formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) colon cancer tissue, and 111 blood leukocyte DNA from blood/plasma donors. These results were correlated with clinical parameters such as TNM stage, tumor localization, tumor differentiation, complexity index, sex, and age. We found that there was a significant association between the CLDN1 genotype CC in tumor samples and a higher risk of colon cancer development (OR 3.0, p < 0.001). We also found that the CLDN7 rs4562 (c.590C>T) genotype CT had a higher risk of lymph node involvement (p = 0.031) and a lower degree of tumor differentiation (p = 0.028). In the control population, the allele frequencies were very similar to those in the HapMap cohort for CLDN7. The CLDN1 rs9869263 genotype (c.369C>T) was related to increased risk of colon cancer, and the CLDN7 rs4562 genotype (c.590C>T) was related to tumor differentiation and lymph node involvement in colon carcinoma. Further studies are warranted to ascertain their potential uses as biomarkers predicting tumor development, proliferation, and outcome in this disease."}

Severity of lung disease, the main cause of mortality among CF patients, is likely modulated by several genes. The mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) gene encodes an innate immune response protein and has been implicated as a pulmonary modifier in CF. However, reports have been conflicting, and interactions with other modifiers have not been investigated. We therefore evaluated the association of MBL2 with CF pulmonary phenotype in a cohort of 1,019 Canadian pediatric CF patients. MBL2 genotypes were combined into low-, intermediate-, and high-expression groups based on MBL2 levels in plasma. Analysis of age at first infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that MBL2 deficiency was significantly associated with earlier onset of infection. This MBL2 effect was amplified in patients with high-producing genotypes of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1). Similarly, MBL2 deficiency was associated with more rapid decline of pulmonary function, most significantly in those carrying the high-producing TGFB1 genotype. These findings provide evidence of gene-gene interaction in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease, whereby high TGF-beta1 production enhances the modulatory effect of MBL2 on the age of first bacterial infection and the rate of decline of pulmonary function."}

Based on this review, we identified gene mutations inherited by the fetus that could predispose to preterm birth as a result of PPROM. The responsible genes include COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, COL1A2, TNXB, PLOD1, ADAMTS2, CRTAP, LEPRE1 and ZMPSTE24. Marfan syndrome, caused by FBN1 mutations, and polymorphisms in the COL1A1 and TGFB1 genes have been associated with cervical incompetence. We speculate that an analysis of sequence variation at the loci noted above will reveal polymorphisms that may contribute to susceptibility to PPROM and cervical incompetence in the general population."}

Using 1087 datasets and publicly available data from genome-wide association platforms, meta-analyses using dominant and recessive models were performed on 241 associations between individual variants and specific cancer types that had been tested in two or more independent studies. The epidemiological strength of each association was graded with Venice criteria that assess amount of evidence, replication, and protection from bias. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nThirty-one nominally statistically significant (ie, P < .05 without adjustment for multiple comparisons) associations were recorded for 16 genes in dominant and/or recessive model analyses (BRCA2, CCND1, ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC4, ERCC5, MGMT, NBN, PARP1, POLI, TP53, XPA, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, and XRCC4). XRCC1, XRCC2, TP53, and ERCC2 variants were each nominally associated with several types of cancer. Three associations were graded as having \"strong\" credibility, another four had modest credibility, and 24 had weak credibility based on Venice criteria. Requiring more stringent P values to account for multiplicity of comparisons, only the associations of ERCC2 codon 751 (recessive model) and of XRCC1 -77 T>C (dominant model) with lung cancer had P <or= .0001 and retained P <or= .001 even when the first published studies on the respective associations were excluded.\nWe have conducted meta-analyses of 241 associations between variants in DNA repair genes and cancer and have found sparse association signals with strong epidemiological credibility.

Interestingly, some of the strongest signals of association observed in these studies arise from non-coding regions located in very large introns or far away from any annotated genes, raising the possibility that these regions are involved in the etiology of the disease through some unidentified regulatory mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of better understanding the mechanisms leading to inter-individual differences in gene expression in humans. Most of the existing approaches developed to identify common regulatory polymorphisms are based on linkage/association mapping of gene expression to genotypes. However, these methods have some limitations, notably their cost and the requirement of extensive genotyping information from all the individuals studied which limits their applications to a specific cohort or tissue. Here we describe a robust and high-throughput method to directly measure differences in allelic expression for a large number of genes using the Illumina Allele-Specific Expression BeadArray platform and quantitative sequencing of RT-PCR products. We show that this approach allows reliable identification of differences in the relative expression of the two alleles larger than 1.5-fold (i.e., deviations of the allelic ratio larger than 60:40) and offers several advantages over the mapping of total gene expression, particularly for studying humans or outbred populations. Our analysis of more than 80 individuals for 2,968 SNPs located in 1,380 genes confirms that differential allelic expression is a widespread phenomenon affecting the expression of 20% of human genes and shows that our method successfully captures expression differences resulting from both genetic and epigenetic cis-acting mechanisms."}

Moreover, although resequencing of TTC21B in a large, clinically diverse ciliopathy cohort and matched controls showed a similar frequency of rare changes, in vivo and in vitro evaluations showed a significant enrichment of pathogenic alleles in cases (P < 0.003), suggesting that TTC21B contributes pathogenic alleles to \u223c5% of ciliopathy cases.

Polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers was used to genotype cytokine SNPs and HLA-DRB1 alleles in 151 diabetics and 140 healthy individuals of Slovak origin. Univariate analysis showed that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 codon 10 TT homozygotes were significantly more susceptible to developing T1D than C allele carriers (P (c) = 0.0066, OR = 2.46). Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha -308 A allele carriers were also significantly overrepresented among the diabetics (P (c) = 0.0031, OR = 2.62); however, the association of the -308 A allele with T1D might be due to its strong linkage disequilibrium with the susceptibility allele HLA-DRB1*0301. An association was also found with interleukin (IL)-6 -174 G/C and nt565 G/A SNPs; however, its significance was lost when statistical correction was applied. These data suggest that the TGF-beta1 codon 10 SNP is among numerous genetic variations with small individual effects on T1D development. Moreover, a possible role of TNF-alpha and IL-6 SNPs cannot be ruled out, although their association with T1D was due to strong LD with the HLA class II susceptibility allele or did not withstand statistical correction, respectively."}

Considering that many genes are involved in the complex inflammation responses and many genetic variants in these genes have the potential to alter the functions and expression of these genes, we assembled a list of key inflammation-related genes to facilitate the identification of genetic associations of diseases with an inflammation-related etiology. We first reviewed various phases of inflammation responses, including the development of immune cells, sensing of danger, influx of cells to sites of insult, activation and functional responses of immune and non-immune cells, and resolution of the immune response. Assisted by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we then identified 17 functional sub-pathways that are involved in one or multiple phases. This organization would greatly increase the chance of detecting gene-gene interactions by hierarchical clustering of genes with their functional closeness in a pathway. Finally, as an example application, we have developed tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) arrays for populations of European and African descent to capture all the common variants of these key inflammation-related genes. Assays of these tSNPs have been designed and assembled into two Affymetrix ParAllele customized chips, one each for European (12,011 SNPs) and African (21,542 SNPs) populations. These tSNPs have greater coverage for these inflammation-related genes compared to the existing genome-wide arrays, particularly in the African population. These tSNP arrays can facilitate systematic evaluation of inflammation pathways in disease susceptibility. For additional applications, other genotyping platforms could also be employed. For existing genome-wide association data, this list of key inflammation-related genes and associated subpathways can facilitate comprehensive inflammation pathway- focused association analyses."}

Most of these alterations, if not repaired, can result in genetic instability, mutagenesis and cell death. DNA repair mechanisms are important for maintaining DNA integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. Recent lung cancer studies have focused on identifying the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, among which DNA repair genes are increasingly being studied. Genetic variations in DNA repair genes are thought to modulate DNA repair capacity and are suggested to be related to lung cancer risk. We identified a sufficient number of epidemiologic studies on lung cancer to conduct a meta-analysis for genetic polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair pathway genes, focusing on xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), ERCC2/XPD, ERCC4/XPF and ERCC5/XPG. We found an increased risk of lung cancer among subjects carrying the ERCC2 751Gln/Gln genotype (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14 - 1.49). We found a protective effect of the XPA 23G/G genotype (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.59 - 0.95). Considering the data available, it can be conjectured that if there is any risk association between a single SNP and lung cancer, the risk fluctuation will probably be minimal. Advances in the identification of new polymorphisms and in high-throughput genotyping techniques will facilitate the analysis of multiple genes in multiple DNA repair pathways. Therefore, it is likely that the defining feature of future epidemiologic studies will be the simultaneous analysis of large samples."}

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is considered as the most versatile DNA repair pathway to deal with a variety of different DNA lesions. ERCC1 and ERCC2 are the two important proteins in NER pathway.

So far, 13 breast cancer susceptibility genes of high or moderate penetrance have been identified. This review summarizes findings on these genes in Han Chinese. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the 2 most important susceptibility genes. They have a relatively low mutation rate, and the most frequent sites of mutation are in exon 11. Frameshift mutations are the main type of mutation. Founder mutations may also exist, and BRCA-associated breast cancer has specific clinicopathologic characteristics. TP53 and PALB2 are relatively rare susceptibility genes. The relationship between the other 9 genes and breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. At present, the mutation spectrum for these susceptibility genes is not well understood in the Chinese population, and there are few reports on prognosis and clinical intervention in high-risk populations. Therefore, the true value of genetic counseling for breast cancer has yet to be realized. This article reviews studies of hereditary breast cancer in the Han Chinese population, highlights potential inadequacies, and provides a foundation for genetic counseling for breast cancer in China."}

The genetic association of DLS remains largely unclear.

A total of 9 coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) in NMDA receptor genes [GRIN2A (rs8049651, Leu425Leu; rs9806806, Tyr730Tyr); GRIN2B (rs7301328, Pro122Pro; rs35025065, Asp447Asp; rs1805522, Ile602Ile; rs1806201, Thr888Thr; rs1805247, His1399His); and GRIN2C (rs689730, Ala33Ala; rs3744215, Arg1209Ser)] were selected and genotyped using direct sequencing in 70 patients with DLS and 141 healthy controls. Multiple logistic models (codominant, dominant and recessive) were calculated for the odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and corresponding P-values. The SNPStats, SNPAnalyzer and HelixTree programs were used for the evaluation of the genetic data. Among the SNPs examined, no significant associations were observed between the NMDA receptor genes and DLS. When the patients were divided into two groups according to clinical characteristics based on Cobb's angle (<20\u00b0 or \u226520\u00b0) and lateral listhesis (<6 mm or \u22656 mm), associations were observed between rs689730 of GRIN2C and Cobb's angle (codominant, P=0.038; dominant, P=0.022) and between rs7301328 of GRIN2B and lateral listhesis (codominant, P=0.003; dominant, P=0.015; recessive, P=0.015). These results indicate that the GRIN2A, GRIN2B and GRIN2C genes do not affect the development of DLS. However, the GRIN2C gene may be associated with Cobb's angle, while the GRIN2B gene may be associated with lateral listhesis."}

However, these statistical associations only provide evidence for genomic regions likely to harbor a causal gene(s) and do not directly identify such genes. We combined gene variation and expression data in a human cohort to identify causal genes.\nGlobal gene transcription activity was obtained for each individual in a large human cohort (n = 1,240). These quantitative transcript data were tested for correlation with genotype data generated from the same individuals to identify gene expression patterns influenced by the variants.\nVariant rs8050136 lies within intron 1 of the FTO gene on chromosome 16 and marks a locus strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and obesity and widely replicated across many populations. We report that genetic variation at this locus does not influence FTO gene expression levels (P = 0.38), but is strongly correlated with expression of RBL2 (P = 2.7 x 10(-5)), approximately 270,000 base pairs distant to FTO.\nThese data suggest that variants at FTO influence RBL2 gene expression at large genetic distances. This observation underscores the complexity of human transcriptional regulation and highlights the utility of large human cohorts in which both genetic variation and global gene expression data are available to identify disease genes. Expedient identification of genes mediating the effects of genome-wide association study-identified loci will enable mechanism-of-action studies and accelerate understanding of human disease processes under genetic influence."}

SNPs introducing premature termination codons (PTCs), herein called X-SNPs, can alter the stability and function of transcripts and proteins and thus are considered to be biologically important. Initial studies suggested a strong selection against such variations/mutations. In this study, we undertook a genome-wide systematic screening to identify human X-SNPs using the dbSNP database. Our results demonstrated the presence of 28 X-SNPs from 28 genes with known minor allele frequencies. Eight X-SNPs (28.6 per cent) were predicted to cause transcript degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Seventeen X-SNPs (60.7 per cent) resulted in moderate to severe truncation at the C-terminus of the proteins (deletion of >50 per cent of the amino acids). The majority of the X-SNPs (78.6 per cent) represent commonly occurring SNPs, by contrast with the rarely occurring disease-causing PTC mutations. Interestingly, X-SNPs displayed a non-uniform distribution across human populations: eight X-SNPs were reported to be prevalent across three different human populations, whereas six X-SNPs were found exclusively in one or two population(s). In conclusion, we have systematically investigated human SNPs introducing PTCs with respect to their possible biological consequences, distributions across different human populations and evolutionary aspects. We believe that the SNPs reported here are likely to affect gene/protein function, although their biological and evolutionary roles need to be further investigated."}

In this review, the immunosuppressants used for the PHTx are introduced, including their similarities and differences in immunosuppressive mechanisms of action, and their unique clinical efficacy and safety issues in relation to genetic polymorphisms in the genes that encode drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters and drug targets. In addition, genetic susceptibility to severe drug-associated complications and strategies for their prevention and treatment are discussed. Moreover, clinically important drug-drug, drug-herb, or drug-food interactions and the effects of demographic and clinical covariates of recipients and donors on clinical endpoints of the PHTx are summarized, respectively. All relevant data are focused mainly on the PHTx. Information provided in this review would be useful for pediatric patient care, in particular for personalized medication, because each and every valuable piece could be fitted to the big picture of how organ rejection would be delayed and even avoided after personalized immunosuppressive therapy."}

We examined whether polymorphisms in the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B subunit gene (GRIN2B) influence decision-making using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). In total, 245 (n = 245, 127 female) healthy German students were included in the analysis. Two synonymous SNPs in exon 13, rs1806191 (H1178H) and rs1806201 (T888T) showed the strongest association with aspects of IGT performance. Females with a CC allele in rs1806201 made less use both of a win-stay strategy and demonstrated more exploratory behaviour during task execution. For rs1806191, we found a strong additive effect in usage of a win-stay strategy. This, partly sex-dependent, correlation of the win-stay/lose-shift behaviour with GRIN2B genotypes suggests that healthy individuals with certain GRIN2B variations respond differently to ambiguous conditions, possibly by altered perception of wins and losses. These findings underline the necessity to integrate the glutamatergic system when examining decision-making processes."}

Analyzing genetic interactions between variants (epistasis) is one of the potential ways forward. We investigated the abundance and functional impact of a specific type of epistasis, namely the interaction between regulatory and protein-coding variants. Using genotype and gene expression data from the 210 unrelated individuals of the original four HapMap populations, we have explored the combined effects of regulatory and protein-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We predict that about 18% (1,502 out of 8,233 nsSNPs) of protein-coding variants are differentially expressed among individuals and demonstrate that regulatory variants can modify the functional effect of a coding variant in cis. Furthermore, we show that such interactions in cis can affect the expression of downstream targets of the gene containing the protein-coding SNP. In this way, a cis interaction between regulatory and protein-coding variants has a trans impact on gene expression. Given the abundance of both types of variants in human populations, we propose that joint consideration of regulatory and protein-coding variants may reveal additional genetic effects underlying complex traits and disease and may shed light on causes of differential penetrance of known disease variants."}

To date, 44 different BRCA1/2 variants have been identified in 55 HBOC families. Of the seven newly reported mutations, only BRCA1 Q284X is clearly deleterious. The analysis of clinical disease characteristics in relation to age of disease onset and family history showed a difference between BRCA1/2 wild type and mutation carrier families. Interestingly, BRCA1/2 mutations were significantly more common in women who developed breast cancer <or=40 years of age than in BRCA1/2 wild type women (50% vs. 29%, respectively, P = 0.005). The family history selection criteria most likely to indicate the presence of deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations are breast cancer <or=35 years (P = 0.012), two first-degree relatives with breast cancer <or=50 years (P = 0.022), and male breast cancer (P = 0.047). The penetrance of BRCA1/2 alterations in our cohort seems to be aligned with other published results. However, new data interpretations have emerged in relation to the clinical criteria and the presence of deleterious mutations.

The asthmatic subjects were further divided into mild and severe groups according to disease severity. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at ADAM33 V4, T2, S2 and T1, and TGF-\u03b21 C-509T and T869C were selected and detected with PCR-RFLP. The associations of the SNPs with asthma risk and severity were analyzed. The associations between the haplotypes of ADAM33 and TGF-\u03b21 were also evaluated. Compared with the GG genotype, the GC and CC genotypes at V4 were associated with an increased asthma risk in children and the ORs were 2.92 and 10.56, respectively. Compared with the CC genotype, the CT/TT genotype at C-509T was associated with an increased asthma risk and the OR was 2.26. Subsequent to stratification by asthma severity, compared with the V4 GG genotype, it was found that the CG and CC genotypes were associated with a mild asthma risk and the ORs were 3.00 and 5.99, respectively. The SNP at C-509T (CT/TT vs. CC) was associated with mild asthma (OR=2.34), whereas a marginally significant association was detected between the SNP (CT/TT vs. CC) and severe asthma risk (OR=2.19). The haplotype analysis revealed that, compared with the GGCA haplotype of ADAM33, significant associations of the haplotypes of CGCG, CGGA, GACA, GACG and GAGA with asthma risk were observed, and the ORs were 31.12, 12.24, 4.73, 30.85 and 4.83, respectively. No significant association was detected between the TGF-\u03b21 haplotypes and asthma risk. The genetic variants at V4 and C-509T had the potential to modify the childhood asthma risk and the associations showed no notable difference with the disease severity. Thus, ADAM33 haplotypes provided more useful information in the prediction of asthma risk."}

In the coding (10 257 bp) and non-coding (2799 bp) sequences of BRCA2, 82 sequence variants were identified. Three different, apparently disease-associated BRCA2 mutations were found in six HBC/HBOC families (8%): two splice site mutations in introns 5 and 21, and one frameshift mutation in exon 11. In the coding region, 53 simple sequence variants were found: 35 missense mutations, one 2 bp deletion (CT) resulting in a stop at codon 3364, one nonsense mutation with a stop at codon 3326, one deletion of a complete codon (AAA) resulting in the loss of leucine, and 15 silent mutations. In the non-coding region, 26 polymorphisms were detected. Of the 79 sequence variants that were not obviously disease-associated, eight were detected only in HBC/HBOC families. The remaining 71 variants were identified in both HBC/HBOC families and control individuals. Sixty three sequence variants (80%) were specific for a continent. Forty two percent (33 out of 79) of the sequence variants were detected exclusively in Africa, though only 13% of the 332 chromosomes screened were of African origin. Our data indicate that, in BRCA2, simple sequence variation is frequent [in the coding region 1 in 194 bp (straight theta = 2.2 x 10(-4)), and in the non-coding region 1 in 108 bp (straight theta = 4.4 x 10(-4)), respectively]."}

We have conducted association studies in breast cancer using an empirical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tagging approach to capture common genetic variation in genes that are candidates for breast cancer based on their known function. We genotyped 710 SNPs in 120 candidate genes in up to 4,400 breast cancer cases and 4,400 controls using a staged design. Correction for population stratification was done using the genomic control method, on the basis of data from 280 genomic control SNPs. Evidence for association with each SNP was assessed using a Cochran-Armitage trend test (p-trend) and a two-degrees of freedom chi(2) test for heterogeneity (p-het). The most significant single SNP (p-trend = 8 x 10(-5)) was not significant at a nominal 5% level after adjusting for population stratification and multiple testing. To evaluate the overall evidence for an excess of positive associations over the proportion expected by chance, we applied two global tests: the admixture maximum likelihood (AML) test and the rank truncated product (RTP) test corrected for population stratification. The admixture maximum likelihood experiment-wise test for association was significant for both the heterogeneity test (p = 0.0031) and the trend test (p = 0.017), but no association was observed using the rank truncated product method for either the heterogeneity test or the trend test (p = 0.12 and p = 0.24, respectively). Genes in the cell-cycle control pathway and genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism and signalling were the main contributors to the association. These results suggest that a proportion of SNPs in these candidate genes are associated with breast cancer risk, but that the effects of individual SNPs is likely to be small. Large sample sizes from multicentre collaboration will be needed to identify associated SNPs with certainty."}

The aim of the present study was to identify potential markers of cytokines genes associated with the susceptibility to HCV infection. The cohort was composed of 128 individuals infected by HCV and 94 healthy controls. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-SSP. The distributions of the following polymorphisms were compared in these groups: TNF-alpha (-308G/A [rs1800629]), TGF-beta1 (codon 10 T/C [rs1982073], codon 25 G/C [rs1800471]), IL-10 (-1082 A/G [rs 1800896]; -819T/C [rs1800871]; -592A/C [rs 1800872]), IL-6 (-174G/C [rs1800795]), and IFN-gamma (+874T/A [rs2430561]). This study demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the frequency of TGF-beta1 codon 25 polymorphism between healthy subjects and those infected with HCV. No associations were observed between polymorphisms of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-10, TGF-beta1 codon 10, and IL-6 and HCV infection. These findings suggest that TGF-beta1 codon 25 polymorphism could be a host genetic factor associated with susceptibility to HCV infection."}

The risk of femoral neck stress fracture was significantly higher in subjects with low weight and body mass index (BMI). An interaction between the CTR (rs1801197) minor allele C and the VDR C-A haplotype was observed, and subjects lacking the C allele in CTR and/or the C-A haplotype in VDR had a 3-fold higher risk of stress fracture than subjects carrying both (OR = 3.22, 95% CI 1.38-7.49, p = 0.007). In addition, the LRP5 haplotype A-G-G-C alone and in combination with the VDR haplotype C-A was associated with stress fractures through reduced body weight and BMI.\nOur findings suggest that genetic factors play a role in the development of stress fractures in individuals subjected to heavy exercise and mechanical loading.

Two of these loci map to genes (TCF7L2 and TGFB1) with established roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Four other loci are located in or near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (ZMIZ1), genome maintenance (FEN1), fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), cancer cell motility and metastasis (CD9), and cell growth and differentiation (NXN). We also found suggestive evidence for three additional loci associated with CRC risk near genome-wide significance at 8q24.11, 10q21.1 and 10q24.2.

The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate (\"impute\") unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, Bim-Bam, available from the Stephens Lab website http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html."}

The study validated gender-dependent association between genomic SCN1A rs3812718 polymorphism and TTR in CRC patients treated with adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy. This study confirms that voltage-gated Na+ channels may be a potential therapeutic target and a useful predictive biomarker before 5-FU infusion."}

Although the pathogenesis of MS remains unknown, it is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease mediated by T-lymphocytes directed against myelin proteins and/or other oligodendrocyte epitopes.\nIn this study we investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood cells from patients with RRMS during the relapse and the remission phases utilizing gene microarray technology. Dysregulated genes encoded in regions associated with MS susceptibility from genomic screens or previous transcriptomic studies were identified. The proximal promoter region polymorphisms of two genes were tested for association with disease and expression level.\nDistinct sets of dysregulated genes during the relapse and remission phases were identified including genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation. Three of these dysregulated genes have been previously implicated with MS susceptibility in genomic screens: TGFbeta1, CD58 and DBC1. TGFbeta1 has one common SNP in the proximal promoter: -508 T>C (rs1800469). Genotyping two Australian trio sets (total 620 families) found a trend for over-transmission of the T allele in MS in females (p < 0.13). Upregulation of CD58 and DBC1 in remission is consistent with their putative roles in promoting regulatory T cells and reducing cell proliferation, respectively. A fourth gene, ALOX5, is consistently found over-expressed in MS. Two common genetic variants were confirmed in the ALOX5 putative promoter: -557 T>C (rs12762303) and a 6 bp tandem repeat polymorphism (GGGCGG) between position -147 and -176; but no evidence for transmission distortion found.\nThe dysregulation of these genes tags their metabolic pathways for further investigation for potential therapeutic intervention."}

Susceptibility to renal cyst formation in the (cy/+) rat is caused by a missense mutation in Pkdr1 encoding the novel protein SamCystin. To initiate studies of the human orthologous gene, we determined the location and the organization of human PKDR1. We genotyped microsatellite markers flanking the human ortholog in PKD families that either are unlinked to known PKD genes, or in which mutations have not yet been identified and carried out mutation analysis in PKD patients. We identified eight novel single nucleotide polymorphisms, including three leading to amino acid changes. These variants are unlikely to account for PKD in these patients, yet the screening of other affected populations may provide information about the involvement of PKDR1 as a modifier gene in cystic kidney disease."}

However, in a large fraction of CRC cases, no known genetic syndrome or family history can be identified, suggesting the presence of \"missing heritability\" in CRC etiology. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) platform has led to the identification of multiple replicable common genetic variants associated with CRC risk. These newly discovered genetic variations might account for a portion of the missing heritability. Here, we summarize the recent GWASs related to newly identified genetic variants associated with CRC risk and clinical outcome. The findings from these studies suggest that there is a lack of understanding of the mechanism of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with CRC. In addition, the utility of SNPs as prognostic markers of CRC in clinical settings remains to be further assessed. Finally, the currently validated SNPs explain only a small fraction of total heritability in complex-trait diseases like CRC. Thus, the \"missing heritability\" still needs to be explored further. Future epidemiological and functional investigations of these variants will add to our understanding of CRC pathogenesis, and may ultimately lead to individualized strategies for prevention and treatment of CRC."}

To rapidly detect all possible changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the breast cancer genes, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. All exons of both genes are covered by the DGGE scan, comprising 120 amplicons. We use a semiautomated approach, amplifying all individual amplicons with the same PCR program, after which the amplicons are pooled. DGGE is performed using three slightly different gel conditions. Validation was performed using DNA samples with known sequence variants in 107 of the 120 amplicons; all variants were detected. This DGGE mutation scanning, in combination with a PCR test for two Dutch founder deletions in BRCA1 was then applied in 431 families in which 52 deleterious changes and 70 unclassified variants were found. Fifteen unclassified variants were not reported before. The system was easily adopted by five other laboratories, where in another 3,593 families both exons 11 were analyzed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and the remaining exons by DGGE. In total, a deleterious change (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site mutation, or large deletion) was found in 661 families (16.4%), 462 in BRCA1 (11.5%), 197 in BRCA2 (4.9%), and in two index cases a deleterious change in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 was identified. Eleven deleterious changes in BRCA1 and 36 in BRCA2 had not been reported before. In conclusion, this DGGE mutation screening method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is proven to be highly sensitive and is easy to adopt, which makes screening of large numbers of patients feasible. The results of screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in more than 4,000 families present a valuable overview of mutations in the Dutch population."}

The possible association of this polymorphism with bone mass and the prevalence of osteoporosis has now been investigated in a total of 287 postmenopausal women from two regions (Obu City, Aichi Prefecture, and Sanda City, Hyogo Prefecture) of Japan. A significant association of TGF-beta1 genotype with bone mass was detected in both populations; bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine was greater in individuals with the CC genotype than in those with the TT or TC genotype. The frequency of vertebral fractures was significantly lower in individuals with the CC genotype than in those with the TC or TT genotypes. For each region, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in subjects with osteoporosis than in controls. Also, the serum concentration of TGF-beta1 in individuals with the CC genotype was significantly higher than that in age-matched subjects with the TC or TT genotype in osteoporotic or osteopenic as well as healthy control groups. These results suggest that the T/C polymorphism of the TGF-beta1 gene is one of the genetic determinants of bone mass and that the T allele is an independent risk factor for the genetic susceptibility to osteoporosis in postmenopausal Japanese women. Thus, analysis of the TGF-beta1 genotype may be useful in the prevention and management of osteoporosis."}

We found that there was a significant difference between patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage and control subjects with respect to genotype distribution (\u03c7(2)=16.33, P<0.001) and allelic frequencies (\u03c7(2)=15.01; P<0.001; odds ratio 2.261; 95% confidence interval 1.482-3.451) for the rs42524 polymorphism of COL1A2. Adjustment for risk factors did not change our conclusions. We conclude that the COL1A2 rs42524 polymorphism could be a genetic risk factor for primary intracerebral hemorrhage among Han Chinese."}

Recent studies have demonstrated interactions between bone and immune cells, and that cytokines produced by immune cells regulate bone turnover. In this study, we examined the associations between bone mineral density (BMD) and polymorphisms in genes encoding interleukin (IL)-6 (-634C>G; rs1800796), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (-308G>A; rs1800629), IL-17F (7488T>C; rs763780), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 (869T>C; rs1800470), osteoprotegerin (OPG; 163A>G; rs3102735) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; 677C>T; rs1801133) in young and elderly Japanese women. Whole-body, lumbar spine (L(1) or L(2)-L(4)), and femoral neck BMD were measured in 100 young subjects (18-23 years), and 100 elderly subjects (60-83 years). Whole-body, lumbar spine, and femoral neck BMD were 1.13\u00b10.06, 1.14\u00b10.12, and 1.00\u00b10.11 g/cm(2), respectively, in young subjects, and 0.92\u00b10.09, 0.86\u00b10.15, and 0.63\u00b10.10 g/cm(2), respectively, in elderly subjects. The frequencies of the IL-6 CC, CG, and GG genotypes were 48%, 49%, and 3%, respectively. The frequencies of the IL17F TT, TC, and CC genotypes were 79%, 15%, and 6%, respectively, in young subjects. Polymorphisms of the IL-6 and IL17F genes were significantly associated with BMD. To our knowledge, this is the first report to examine these associations in a cohort of 200 Japanese women."}

The results represent first findings from the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment (OPPERA) prospective cohort study that monitored 2,737 men and women aged 18 to 44 years recruited at 4 U.S. study sites. During a median 2.8-year follow-up period, 260 participants developed TMD. The average incidence rate of 4% per annum was influenced by a broad range of phenotypic risk factors including sociodemographic characteristics, health status, clinical orofacial factors, psychological functioning, pain sensitivity, and cardiac autonomic responses. A novel method of multivariable analysis used random forest models to simultaneously evaluate contributions of all 202 phenotypic variables. Variables from the health status domain made the greatest contribution to TMD incidence, followed closely by psychological and clinical orofacial domains. However, only a few measures of pain sensitivity and autonomic function contributed to TMD incidence, and their effects were modest. Meanwhile, age and study site were independent predictors of TMD incidence, even after controlling for other phenotypes. Separate analysis of 358 genes that regulate pain found several novel genetic associations with intermediate phenotypes that, themselves, are risk factors for TMD, suggesting new avenues to investigate biological pathways contributing to TMD.\nCollectively, the papers in this issue demonstrate that TMD is a complex disorder with multiple causes consistent with a biopsychosocial model of illness. It is a misnomer and no longer appropriate to regard TMD solely as a localized orofacial pain condition."}

Mutations in GJB2 account for a significant number of ARNSHI (and up to 50% of documented recessive (e.g., more than 1 affected sibling) hearing impairment in some populations). Mutations in the GJB2 gene are amongst the most common causes of hearing impairment in populations of various ethnic backgrounds. Two mutations of this gene, 35delG and 167delT, account for the majority of reported mutations in Caucasian populations, especially those of Mediterranean and Ashkenazi Jewish background. The 235delC mutation is most prevalent in East Asian populations. Some mutations are of less well-characterized significance. The V37I missense mutation, common in Asian populations, was initially described as a polymorphism and later as a potentially pathogenic mutation. We report here on 15 unrelated individuals with ARNSHI and homozygosity for the V37I GJB2 missense mutation. Nine individuals are of Chinese ancestry, two are of unspecified Asian descent, one is of Japanese descent, one individual is of Vietnamese ancestry, one of Philippine background and one of Italian and Cuban/Caucasian background. Homozygosity for the V37I GJB2 mutation may be a more common pathogenic missense mutation in Asian populations, resulting in mild to moderate sensorineural hearing impairment. We report a presumed haplotype block specific to East Asian individuals with the V37I mutation encompassing the GJB2 gene that may account for the high prevalence in East Asian populations."}

Two hundred SNPs were first examined in a 5\u2009Mb region surrounding the D22S278 marker in a sample of 169 families and analyzed using PLINK. The peak of association was a haplotype near the genes stargazin (CACNG2), intraflagellar transport protein homolog 27 (IFT27) and parvalbumin (PVALB; P\u2009=\u20094.69\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-4)).

A total of 30 studies including 20,401 cases and 27,416 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, significantly elevated breast cancer risk was associated with TGFB1 10P allele when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (LP vs. LL: OR = 1.046, 95% CI = 1.003-1.090; dominant model: OR = 1.052, 95% CI = 1.012-1.095). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, statistically significantly elevated risk was found in Caucasians (dominant model: OR = 1.045, 95% CI = 1.001-1.091). When stratified by study design, statistically significantly elevated risk was found based on population-based studies (dominant model: OR = 1.076, 95% CI = 1.019-1.136). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the TGFB1 10P allele may be a low-penetrant risk factor for developing breast cancer. However, large sample and representative population-based studies with homogeneous breast cancer patients and well-matched controls are warranted to confirm this finding."}

It is known that development of valvular calcification is likely to occur among members of a family. However, the knowledge about the role of genomic predictive markers in valvular calcification is still elusive. Aims of this review are to assess the impact of gene polymorphisms on risk and severity of aortic stenosis and mitral annular calcification. According to the results of the investigations carried out, all polymorphisms may be divided into the three groups conferring the level of evidence of their association with valvular stenosis. It is possible to conclude that apoB (XbaI, rs1042031, and rs6725189), ACE (rs4340), IL10 (rs1800896 and rs1800872), and LPA (rs10455872) gene polymorphisms may be associated with valvular calcific stenosis with a relatively high level of evidence. A number of other polymorphisms, such as PvuII polymorphism within the OR\u03b1 gene, rs1042636 polymorphism within the CaSR gene, rs3024491, rs3021094, rs1554286, and rs3024498 polymorphisms within the IL10 gene, rs662 polymorphism within the PON1 gene, rs2276288 polymorphism within the MYO7A gene, rs5194 polymorphism within the AGTR1 gene, rs2071307 polymorphism within the ELN gene, rs17659543 and rs13415097 polymorphisms within the IL1F9 gene may correlate with a risk of calcific valve stenosis with moderate level of evidence. Finally, rs1544410 polymorphism within the VDR gene, E2 and E4 alleles within the apoE gene, rs6254 polymorphism within the PTH gene, and rs1800871 polymorphism within the IL10 gene may be associated with aortic stenosis with low level of evidence."}

The purpose of this study is to investigate the associations of COL1A1 polymorphism with the susceptibility and survival of osteosarcoma. The relative risk to develop osteosarcomas and the overall survival associated to COL1A1 polymorphism were investigated in a homogeneous group of 189 osteosarcomas patients. Correlations with overall survival and hazard ratios (HR) were also analyzed. CT genotype and C allele of COL1A1 at rs1061970, and CG genotype and G allele of COL1A1 at rs2075559 are associated with decreased susceptibility to osteosarcoma in the Chinese population. CC genotype and C allele of COL1A1 at rs1061970 are associated with nonmetastasis in patients. CC genotype and CT genotype of COL1A1 at rs1061970 are associated with lower risk of death. Metastasis was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides the first evidence for the association between COL1A1 polymorphism and osteosarcoma risk in Chinese and shows that COL1A1 polymorphism at rs1061970 has a prognostic value for overall survival in osteosarcoma patients."}

A number of candidate gene case-control studies have been performed on spontaneous PTD, but the results have been inconsistent, and do not fully assess the role of how two genotypes can impact outcome. To elucidate this latter point we re-analyzed data from a previously published case-control candidate gene study, using a case-parent triad design and a hybrid design combining case-parent triads and control-mother dyads. These methods offer a robust approach to genetic association studies for PTD compared to traditional case-control designs.\nThe study participants were obtained from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). A total of 196 case triads and 211 control dyads were selected for the analysis. A case-parent triad design as well as a hybrid design was used to analyze 1,326 SNPs from 159 candidate genes. We compared our results to those from a previous case-control study on the same samples. Haplotypes were analyzed using a sliding window of three SNPs and a pathway analysis was performed to gain biological insight into the pathophysiology of preterm delivery.\nThe most consistent significant fetal gene across all analyses was COL5A2. The functionally similar COL5A1 was significant when combining fetal and maternal genotypes. PON1 was significant with analytical approaches for single locus association of fetal genes alone, but was possibly confounded by maternal effects. Focal adhesion (hsa04510), Cell Communication (hsa01430) and ECM receptor interaction (hsa04512) were the most constant significant pathways.\nThis study suggests a fetal association of COL5A2 and a combined fetal-maternal association of COL5A1 with spontaneous PTD.

Understanding the molecular basis of allelic expression differences is thus an important challenge. Although many genes have been shown to display differential allelic expression, this is the first study to examine in detail the cumulative effects of multiple cis-regulatory polymorphisms responsible for allele-specific expression differences. We have used a variety of experimental approaches to identify and characterize cis-regulatory polymorphisms responsible for the extreme allele-specific expression differences of keratin-1 (KRT1) in human white blood cells. The combined data from our analyses provide strong evidence that the KRT1 allelic expression differences result from the haplotypic combinations and interactions of five cis-regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose alleles differ in their affinity to bind transcription factors and modulate KRT1 promoter activity. Two of these cis-regulatory SNPs bind transcriptional activators with the alleles on the high-expressing KRT1 haplotype pattern having a higher affinity than the alleles on the low-expressing haplotype pattern. In contrast, the other three cis-regulatory SNPs bind transcriptional inhibitors with the alleles on the low-expressing haplotype pattern having a higher affinity than the alleles on the high-expressing haplotype pattern. Our study provides important new insights into the degree of complexity that the cis-regulatory sequences responsible for allele-specific transcriptional regulation have. These data suggest that allelic expression differences result from the cumulative contribution of multiple DNA sequence polymorphisms, with each having a small effect, and that allele-specific expression can thus be viewed as a complex trait."}

Methods and Results. All subjects who gave informed consent for genetic research were divided into two groups: the subjects treated with azelnidipine or temocapril, for 52 weeks. We selected 18 susceptible genes for hypertension and determined their genotypes using TaqMan PCR method. RNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood, and quantitative real time PCR for all genes was performed using TaqMan method. One of the polymorphisms of the RGS2 gene was extracted as being able to influence the effect of these treatments to reduce BP. At eight weeks, BP change showed a significant interaction between the A-638G polymorphism of Regulator of G protein signaling-2 (RGS2) gene and treatment with azelnidipine or temocapril. There was no gene whose expression was associated with BP phenotypes or the polymorphisms of each gene. Conclusions. A-638G polymorphism of the RGS-2 gene could be a predictive factor for therapeutic performance of Ca channel blockers."}

Key genes are those involved in the repair of the DNA damage caused by such agents. This paper describes the results of a case-control epidemiological study designed to determine the genotypes of four of these genes in persons exposed to a single genotoxic factor, i.e. asbestos, who had or had not developed malignant mesothelioma (MM). Our working hypothesis was that an imperfect DNA repair, as revealed by subtle polymorphic variants, could reduce protection against the chronic DNA insult provoked by asbestos and eventually result in mutagenesis and cancer. Seven variants (i.e. XRCC1-R399Q-NCBI SNP, XRCC1-R194W, XRCC3-T241M, XRCC3-IVS6-14, XPD-K751Q, XPD-D312N, OGG1-S326C) were investigated in 81 patients and 110 age and sex-matched controls, all residents at Casale Monferrato, a Piedmontese town highly exposed to asbestos pollution. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When considered as a categorical variable, XRCC1-399Q showed an increased OR both in heterozygotes (OR=2.08; 95% CI=1.00-4.33) and homozygotes (2.38; 95% CI=0.82-6.94), although individual ORs were not significant. When it was considered as a continuous variable OR was significant (OR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.02-2.75). When genotypes were divided into \"non-risk\" and \"risk\" genotypes, i.e. those thought to be associated with increased risk in the light of the functional significance of the variants, XRCC1-399Q (Q homozygotes+Q/R heterozygotes versus R homozygotes) had an OR=2.147 (95% CI: 1.08-4.28), whereas that of XRCC3-241T (T homozygotes+M/T heterozygotes versus M homozygotes) was 4.09 (95% CI: 1.26-13.21) and that of OGG1-326C was increased, though not significantly. None of the haplotypes showed a significantly different frequency between patients and controls. This is the first report of an association between polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and asbestos-associated MM. Our data indicate that genetic factors are involved in MM development."}

The majority of cases are sporadic. Although multiple genetic loci have been tentatively implicated in HLHS, no gene or pathway seems to be specifically associated with the disease. To elucidate the genetic basis of HLHS, we analyzed 53 well-characterized patients with isolated HLHS using an integrated genomic approach that combined DNA sequencing of five candidate genes (NKX2-5, NOTCH1, HAND1, FOXC2 and FOXL1) and genome-wide screening by high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization. In 30 patients, we identified two novel de novo mutations in NOTCH1, 23 rare patients inherited gene variants in NOTCH1, FOXC2 and FOXL1, and 33 rare patients mostly inherited copy-number variants. Some of the identified variations coexisted in the same patient. The biological significance of such rare variations is unknown, but our findings strengthen the role of NOTCH pathway in cardiac valve development, indicating that HLHS is, at least in part, a 'valve' disease. This is the first report of de novo mutations associated with isolated HLHS. Moreover, the coexistence of multiple rare variants suggests in some cases a cumulative effect, as shown for other complex disease."}

Variations of GRIN1 have been identified as a risk factor for schizophrenia and drug dependence, supporting hypotheses of glutamatergic dysfunction in these disorders.

The present study examined two polymorphisms of GRIN1, rs11146020 (G1001C) and rs1126442 (G2108A), in 100 male Thai METH-dependent patients and 103 healthy controls using PCR-RFLP techniques. Neither polymorphism was significantly associated with METH dependence, although rs1126442 was highly significantly associated with METH-dependent psychosis, in which the A allele showed reduced frequency (P<0.00001). The present findings indicate that the rs1126442 of GRIN1 contributes to the genetic vulnerability to psychosis in METH-dependent subjects in the Thai population."}

Statistical methods are widely used to search for a good model of gene-gene interaction for disease analysis, and the previously determined models have successfully explained the effects between SNPs and diseases. However, the huge numbers of potential combinations of SNP genotypes limit the use of statistical methods for analysing high-order interaction, and finding an available high-order model of gene-gene interaction remains a challenge. In this study, an improved particle swarm optimization with double-bottom chaotic maps (DBM-PSO) was applied to assist statistical methods in the analysis of associated variations to disease susceptibility. A big data set was simulated using the published genotype frequencies of 26 SNPs amongst eight genes for breast cancer. Results showed that the proposed DBM-PSO successfully determined two- to six-order models of gene-gene interaction for the risk association with breast cancer (odds ratio > 1.0; P value <0.05). Analysis results supported that the proposed DBM-PSO can identify good models and provide higher chi-square values than conventional PSO. This study indicates that DBM-PSO is a robust and precise algorithm for determination of gene-gene interaction models for breast cancer."}

The tag SNPs were selected using Haploview version 4.2 software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/haploview/haploview, accessed 18 Sept 2009). Monotherapy with CBZ was administered to patients with new-onset focal seizures.

A possible explanation for the capacity our genome to generate this virtually unlimited range of phenotypic variation in complex traits is to assume functional interactions between genes. Therefore we searched two mammalian genomes to identify potential epistatic interactions by looking for co-adapted genes marked by excess two-locus genetic differentiation between populations/lineages using publicly available SNP genotype data. The practical motivation for this effort is to reduce the number of pair-wise tests that need to be performed in genome-wide association studies aimed at detecting GxG interactions, by focusing on pairs predicted to be more likely to jointly affect variation in complex traits. Hence, this approach generates a list of candidate interactions that can be empirically tested. In both the mouse and human data we observed two-locus genetic differentiation in excess of what can be expected from chance alone based on simulations. In an attempt to validate our hypothesis that pairs of genes showing excess genetic divergence represent potential functional interactions, we selected a small set of gene combinations postulated to be interacting based on our analyses and looked for a combined effect of the selected genes on variation in complex traits in both mice and man. In both cases the individual effect of the genes were not significant, instead we observed marginally significant interaction effects. These results show that genome wide searches for gene-gene interactions based on population genetic data are feasible and can generate interesting candidate gene pairs to be further tested for their contribution to phenotypic variation in complex traits."}

In an effort to identify the PSORS1 gene, we cloned and completely sequenced this region from both chromosomes of five individuals. Two of the sequenced haplotypes were associated with psoriasis (risk), and the other eight were clearly unassociated (nonrisk). Comparison of sequence of the two risk haplotypes identified a 298-kb region of homology, extending from just telomeric of HLA-B to the HCG22 gene, which was flanked by clearly nonhomologous regions. Similar haplotypes cloned from unrelated individuals had nearly identical sequence. Combinatorial analysis of exonic variations in the known genes of the candidate interval revealed that HCG27, PSORS1C3, OTF3, TCF19, HCR, STG, and HCG22 bore no alleles unique to risk haplotypes among the 10 sequenced haplotypes. SPR1 and SEEK1 both had messenger RNA alleles specific to risk haplotypes, but only HLA-C and CDSN yielded protein alleles unique to risk. The risk alleles of HLA-C and CDSN (HLA-Cw6 and CDSN*TTC) were genotyped in 678 families with early-onset psoriasis; 620 of these families were also typed for 34 microsatellite markers spanning the PSORS1 interval. Recombinant haplotypes retaining HLA-Cw6 but lacking CDSN*TTC were significantly associated with psoriasis, whereas recombinants retaining CDSN*TTC but lacking HLA-Cw6 were not associated, despite good statistical power. By grouping recombinants with similar breakpoints, the most telomeric quarter of the 298-kb candidate interval could be excluded with high confidence. These results strongly suggest that HLA-Cw6 is the PSORS1 risk allele that confers susceptibility to early-onset psoriasis."}

These types of sample designs can affect Type I error and power properties of statistical tests based on simple random samples. In order to address these issues, we have derived tests of trend based on Wald and quasi-score statistics, with and without assuming a genetic model, that account for the complex sampling design. The finite-sample properties of the proposed test procedures are evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation studies. We make recommendations about the choice of the test statistic depending on whether or not the underlying genetic model is known.

We previously mapped a predisposing locus, TCO (Thyroid tumour with Cell Oxyphilia) on chromosome 19p13.2, for a particular form of thyroid tumour characterised by cells with an abnormal proliferation of mitochondria (oxyphilic or oncocytic cells). In the present work, we report the systematic screening of 14 candidate genes mapping to the region of linkage in affected TCO members, that led us to identify two novel variants respectively in exon 9 and exon 13 of TIMM44, a mitochondrial inner membrane translocase for the import in the mitochondria of nuclear-encoded proteins. These variants were co-segregating with the TCO phenotype, were not present in a large group of controls and were predicted to negatively affect the protein (exon 9 change) or the transcript (exon 13 change). Functional analysis was performed in vitro for both changes and although no dramatic loss of function effects were identified for the mutant alleles, subtler effects might still be present that could alter Timm44 function and thus promote oncocytic tumour development. Thus we suggest that TIMM44 should be considered for further studies in independent samples of affected individuals with TCO."}

By virtue of its greater accuracy and safety with respect to prenatal screening for common autosomal aneuploidies, NIPT has the potential of helping the practice better achieve its aim of facilitating autonomous reproductive choices, provided that balanced pretest information and non-directive counseling are available as part of the screening offer. Depending on the health-care setting, different scenarios for NIPT-based screening for common autosomal aneuploidies are possible. The trade-offs involved in these scenarios should be assessed in light of the aim of screening, the balance of benefits and burdens for pregnant women and their partners and considerations of cost-effectiveness and justice. With improving screening technologies and decreasing costs of sequencing and analysis, it will become possible in the near future to significantly expand the scope of prenatal screening beyond common autosomal aneuploidies. Commercial providers have already begun expanding their tests to include sex-chromosomal abnormalities and microdeletions. However, multiple false positives may undermine the main achievement of NIPT in the context of prenatal screening: the significant reduction of the invasive testing rate. This document argues for a cautious expansion of the scope of prenatal screening to serious congenital and childhood disorders, only following sound validation studies and a comprehensive evaluation of all relevant aspects. A further core message of this document is that in countries where prenatal screening is offered as a public health programme, governments and public health authorities should adopt an active role to ensure the responsible innovation of prenatal screening on the basis of ethical principles. Crucial elements are the quality of the screening process as a whole (including non-laboratory aspects such as information and counseling), education of professionals, systematic evaluation of all aspects of prenatal screening, development of better evaluation tools in the light of the aim of the practice, accountability to all stakeholders including children born from screened pregnancies and persons living with the conditions targeted in prenatal screening and promotion of equity of access."}

Genotyping was conducted for known TGFB1 polymorphisms at the following sites: G-1639-A (G-800-A, rs1800468), C-1348-T (C-509-T, rs1800469), T29-C (Leu10Pro, rs1982073), G74-C (Arg25Pro, rs1800471) and C788-T (Thr263Ile, rs1800472). These polymorphisms were genotyped prospectively and methodology was standardized across research centers. Genotypes and haplotypes were related to BMD at the lumbar sine and femoral neck and fractures.\nThere were no significant differences in either women or men at either skeletal site for any of the examined polymorphisms with the possible exception of a weak association with reduced BMD (-12 mg/cm2) in men with the T-1348 allele (p<0.05). None of the haplotypes was associated with BMD and none of the polymorphisms or haplotypes significantly affected overall risk of fractures, however, the odds ratio for incident vertebral fracture in carriers of the rare T788 allele was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.09-2.64), p<0.05.\nThis study indicates that polymorphic variation in the TGFB1 gene does not play a major role in regulating BMD or susceptibility to fractures. The weak associations we observed between the C-1348-T and lumbar spine BMD in men and between C788-T and risk of incident vertebral fractures are of interest but could be chance findings and will need replication in future studies."}

Substantial evidence of epidemiology suggests that nuclear susceptibility genes, if present, should be sustained by mutation-selection balance without heterozygote advantage. Therefore, putative nuclear susceptibility genes for schizophrenia should meet special conditions for the persistence of the disease as well as the condition of bearing a positive association with the disease.\nWe deduced two criteria that every nuclear susceptibility gene for schizophrenia should fulfill for the persistence of the disease under general assumptions of the multifactorial threshold model. The first criterion demands an upper limit of the case-control difference of the allele frequencies, which is determined by the mutation rate at the locus, and the prevalence and the selection coefficient of the disease. The second criterion demands an upper limit of odds ratio for a given allele frequency in the unaffected population. When we examined the top 30 genes at SZGene and the recently reported common variants on chromosome 6p with the criteria using the epidemiological data in a large-sampled Finnish cohort study, it was suggested that most of these are unlikely to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. The criteria predict that the common disease/common variant hypothesis is unlikely to fit schizophrenia and that nuclear susceptibility genes of moderate effects for schizophrenia, if present, are limited to 'rare variants', 'very common variants', or variants with exceptionally high mutation rates.\nIf we assume the nuclear DNA model for schizophrenia, it should have many susceptibility genes of exceptionally high mutation rates; alternatively, it should have many disease-associated resistance genes of standard mutation rates on different chromosomes. On the other hand, the epidemiological data show that pathogenic genes, if located in the mitochondrial DNA, could persist through sex-related mechanisms."}

However, the extent to which these approaches are mirrored by epidemiological findings has not been fully explored. In this study, we first surveyed SNPs examined in case-control studies of lung cancer, the most extensively studied cancer type. We then computed SNP functional scores using four popular bioinformatics tools: SIFT, PolyPhen, SNPs3D, and PMut, and determined their predictive potential using the odds ratios (ORs) reported. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) for the association with SNP score from SIFT, PolyPhen, SNPs3D, and PMut, and the summary ORs were r=-0.36 (p=0.007), r=0.25 (p=0.068), r=-0.20 (p=0.205), and r=-0.12 (p=0.370), respectively. By creating a combined score using information from all four tools we were able to achieve a correlation coefficient of r=0.51 (p<0.001). These results indicate that scores of predicted functionality could explain a certain fraction of the lung cancer risk detected in genetic association studies and more accurate predictions may be obtained by combining information from a variety of tools. Our findings suggest that bioinformatic tools are useful in predicting SNP functionality and may facilitate future genetic epidemiological studies."}

Because family history remains the strongest single predictor of breast cancer risk, attention has focused on the role of highly penetrant, dominantly inherited genes in cancer-prone kindreds (1). BRCA1 was localized to chromosome 17 through analysis of a set of high-risk kindreds (2), and then identified four years later by a positional cloning strategy (3). BRCA2 was mapped to chromosomal 13q at about the same time (4). Just fifteen months later, Wooster et al.

While these findings provide strong evidence that the identified gene corresponds to BRCA2, only two thirds of the coding sequence and 8 out of 27 exons were isolated and screened; consequently, several questions remained unanswered regarding the nature of BRCA2 and the frequency of mutations in 13q-linked families. We have now determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 (GenBank accession #U43746), and examined its pattern of expression.

In a cohort of 350 Swiss breast-ovarian cancer families, the systematic search for BRCA1/BRCA2 germline mutations was carried out using denaturating high-performance liquid chromatography as the first screening procedure. The screening strategy resulted in the identification of 23 alterations not previously reported: 9 in BRCA1 and 14 in BRCA2. By using the available tools to assign a functional role to newly identified sequence variations, 5 (22%) of these were classified as new disease-causing mutations, 5 (22%) were classified as benign polymorphisms, and the remaining 13 (56%) alterations were considered as unclassified variants. These data illustrate the major challenge for clinical oncologists currently facing the interpretation of alterations identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The key points are to classify these genetic variations as pathogenic mutations, benign polymorphisms, or variants of unknown clinical significance and to adequately use this information for the management of high-risk individuals and their families."}

The correlation between genotype and phenotype for mutations in SMARCB1 has not been determined.\nWe have identified a germline 2631 bp duplication that includes exon 6 of SMARCB1 in a unique family with a four generation history of MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis. This duplication segregates with disease in individuals affected with both conditions, linking MRT predisposition and schwannomatosis as components of the same syndrome in this family.\nThe unique combination of tumours that result from the duplication described in this report may provide important clues about the mechanisms that influence the phenotype associated with a given SMARCB1 mutation."}

We genotyped 88 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 81 genes expected to influence hepatocarcinogenesis using the iPLEX assay. Risk of HCC was clarified by stratifying patients into risk groups based on the multiplied odds ratio (MOR) for SNPs associated with HCC, and the cumulative effects on the development and recurrence of HCC were analyzed.\nSix SNPs associated with risk of HCC were identified (OR range: 0.29-1.76). These included novel SNPs for hepatocarcinogenesis with HCV CCND2 rs1049606, RAD23B rs1805329, CEP164 rs573455, and GRP78rs430397 in addition to the known SNPs MDM2 rs2279744 and ALDH2 rs671. MOR analysis revealed that the highest risk group exerted about a 19-fold higher relative OR compared with the lowest risk group (P = 1.08 \u00d7 10(-5)). Predicted 10-year HCC risk ranged from 1.7% to 96% depending on the risk group and the extent of fibrosis. Recurrence-free survival of radiofrequency ablation-treated HCC in the high risk group (n = 53) was lower than that of low risk group (n = 58, P = 0.038).\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms of CCND2, RAD23B, GRP78, CEP164, MDM2, and ALDH2 genes were significantly associated with development and recurrence of HCC in Japanese patients with HCV."}

To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a regularly updated online database of all published genetic association studies for schizophrenia ('SzGene'). For all polymorphisms having genotype data available in at least four independent case-control samples, we systematically carried out random-effects meta-analyses using allelic contrasts. Across 118 meta-analyses, a total of 24 genetic variants in 16 different genes (APOE, COMT, DAO, DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DTNBP1, GABRB2, GRIN2B, HP, IL1B, MTHFR, PLXNA2, SLC6A4, TP53 and TPH1) showed nominally significant effects with average summary odds ratios of approximately 1.23. Seven of these variants had not been previously meta-analyzed. According to recently proposed criteria for the assessment of cumulative evidence in genetic association studies, four of the significant results can be characterized as showing 'strong' epidemiological credibility. Our project represents the first comprehensive online resource for systematically synthesized and graded evidence of genetic association studies in schizophrenia. As such, it could serve as a model for field synopses of genetic associations in other common and genetically complex disorders."}

Using an oligonucleotide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we systematically examined the nature of this amplification bias, including frequency, degree, and preference for genomic location, and we assessed the effects of this amplification bias on subsequent genotype and chromosomal copy number analyses.\nWe found a large variability in amplification bias among the amplified products obtained by multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and this bias had a severe effect on the genotype and chromosomal copy number analyses. We established optimal experimental conditions for pre-screening for high-quality amplified products, processing array data, and analyzing chromosomal structural alterations. Using this optimized protocol, we successfully detected previously unidentified chromosomal structural alterations in single cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line. These alterations were subsequently confirmed by karyotype analysis. In addition, we successfully obtained reproducible chromosomal copy number profiles of single cells from the cell line with a complex karyotype, indicating the applicability and potential of our optimized workflow.\nOur results suggest that the quality of amplification products should be critically assessed before using them for genomic analyses. The method of MDA-based whole-genome amplification followed by SNP array analysis described here will be useful for exploring chromosomal alterations in single cells."}

Myoclonic seizures developed at 4 months of age in Patient #1 (7 years old), and at 2 months of age in Patient #2 (11 years old), followed by cerebellar ataxia, spastic diplegia, and mental retardation. Both patients had hypoglycorrhachia, and the symptoms were more severe in the latter. CSF and serum glucose levels determined simultaneously showed a CSF/serum glucose ratio of below 0.4 in both patients. In mildly affected Patient #1, the postprandial waking EEG showed improvement in the background activity, as compared to that recorded after overnight fasting, while no significant changes were observed in severely affected Patient #2. In both patients, the functional GLUT1 defect was confirmed by 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake into erythrocytes. Molecular analyses identified heterozygous novel mutations in both patients, within exons 6 and 2 of the GLUT1 gene, respectively. The ketogenic diet was refused in Patient #1, but started in Patient #2 with significant clinical benefit. Fasting CSF analysis and pre-/postprandial EEG changes in children with epileptic seizures and unexplainable neurological deterioration help in diagnosing this potentially treatable disorder."}

Considerable interest has therefore recently focused on the development of methods that efficiently screen genomic regions or whole genomes for gene variants associated with complex phenotypes. One key element in this search is the use of linkage disequilibrium to gain maximal information from typing a selected subset of highly informative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, now often called \"tagging SNPs\" (tSNPs). Probably the most common approach to linkage-disequilibrium gene mapping involves a three-step program: (1) characterization of the haplotype structure in candidate genes or genomic regions of interest, (2) identification of tSNPs sufficient to represent the most common haplotypes, and (3) typing of tSNPs in clinical material. Early definitions of tSNPs focused on the amount of haplotype diversity that they explained. To select tSNPs that would have maximal power in a genetic association study, however, we have developed optimization criteria based on the r2 measure of association and have compared these with other criteria based on the haplotype diversity. To evaluate the full program and to assess how well the selected tags are likely to perform, we have determined the haplotype structure and have assessed tSNPs in the SCN1A gene, an important candidate gene for sporadic epilepsy. We find that as few as four tSNPs are predicted to maintain a consistently high r2 value with all other common SNPs in the gene, indicating that the tags could be used in an association study with only a modest reduction in power relative to direct assays of all common SNPs. This implies that very large case-control studies can be screened for variation in hundreds of candidate genes with manageable experimental effort, once tSNPs are identified. However, our results also show that tSNPs identified in one population may not necessarily perform well in another, indicating that the preliminary study to identify tSNPs and the later case-control study should be performed in the same population. Our results also indicate that tSNPs will not easily identify discrepant SNPs, which lie on importantly discriminating but apparently short genealogical branches. This could significantly complicate tagging approaches for phenotypes influenced by variants that have experienced positive selection."}

Specifically, ADAR2 activity is essential for brain development and function. Herein, we show that the OPHN1 transcript undergoes post-transcriptional modifications such as A-to-I RNA editing and alternative splicing in human brain and other tissues. We found that OPHN1 editing is detectable already at the 18th week of gestation in human brain with a boost of editing at weeks 20 to 33, concomitantly with OPHN1 expression increase and the appearance of a novel OPHN1 splicing isoform. Our results demonstrate that multiple post-transcriptional events occur on OPHN1, a gene playing an important role in brain function and development."}

Metabolic traits pertinent to the central nervous system (CNS) constitute a potentially informative target for genetic studies of intermediate phenotypes as their genetic underpinnings may elucidate etiological mechanisms. We therefore conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of monoamine metabolite (MM) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 414 human subjects from the general population. In a linear model correcting for covariates, we identified one locus associated with MMs at a genome-wide significant level (standardized \u03b2=0.32, P=4.92 \u00d7 10(-8)), located 20 kb from SSTR1, a gene involved with brain signal transduction and glutamate receptor signaling. By subsequent whole-genome expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, we provide evidence that this variant controls expression of PDE9A (\u03b2=0.21; P unadjusted=5.6 \u00d7 10(-7); P corrected=0.014), a gene previously implicated in monoaminergic transmission, major depressive disorder and antidepressant response. A post hoc analysis of loci significantly associated with psychiatric disorders suggested that genetic variation at CSMD1, a schizophrenia susceptibility locus, plays a role in the ratio between dopamine and serotonin metabolites in CSF. The presented DNA and mRNA analyses yielded genome-wide and suggestive associations in biologically plausible genes, two of which encode proteins involved with glutamate receptor functionality. These findings will hopefully contribute to an exploration of the functional impact of the highlighted genes on monoaminergic transmission and neuropsychiatric phenotypes."}

The presence of homozygosity was assessed by genotyping flanking microsatellite markers at each locus in affected individuals. Mutations were detected by sequencing of coding regions of genes. Sequence changes were tested for presence in 100 or more unrelated normal control subjects and for cosegregation in family members.\nHomozygosity was detected at one or more loci in affected individuals of 10 of 34 families. Homozygous disease cosegregating sequence changes (two frame-shift, two missense, and one nonsense; four novel) were found in the TULP1, RLBP1, ABCA4, RPE65, and RP1 genes in 5 of 10 families. These changes were absent in 100 normal control subjects. In addition, several polymorphisms and novel variants were found. All the putative pathogenic changes were associated with severe forms of RP with onset in childhood. Associated macular degeneration was found in three families with mutations in TULP1, ABCA4, and RP1 genes.\nNovel mutations were found in different ARRP genes. Mutations were detected in approximately 15% (5/34) of ARRP families tested, suggesting involvement of other genes in the remaining families."}

Unfortunately, there are additional publications reporting a lack of association with AR when a different cohort of recipients was analyzed for the same SNP. The objective of this report was to attempt replication of these published finding in our own kidney allograft recipient cohort. We analyzed 23 genetic variants, previously reported to have a significant association with AR, using a cohort of 969 clinically well-defined kidney transplant recipients. Only one SNP, rs6025 (Leiden mutation), within the coagulation factor V gene, showed a significant association with a P-value of 0.011 in a race-adjusted analysis and a P-value of 0.0003 in multiple variable analysis. An additional SNP, rs11706052 in IMPDH2, gave a modest P-value of 0.044 using multiple variable analysis, which is not significant when multiple testing is taken into consideration. Our results suggest that careful validation of previously reported associations with AR is necessary, and different strategies other than candidate gene studies can help to identify causative genetic variants associated with AR."}

Two groups-151 young people (78 women and 73 men) aged 20-25, and 140 elderly subjects (101 women and 39 men), aged 65-70 have been investigated. Results show elevated levels of micronuclei and chromosome aberrations in elderly compared with young groups (P<0.001); women had more micronuclei than men (P<0.001).

DNA repair systems that protect the genome from deleterious endogenous and exogenous damages have been shown to have significantly reduced. In particular, enzymes of the nucleotide excision repair pathway are suspected to be implicated in cancer. In this study, 2 functional polymorphisms in a DNA repair gene ERCC2 were analyzed. The population included 911 breast cancer cases, 51 ovarian cancer cases and 1000 controls. The genotyping of 2 SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) was carried out on the population with the MGB (Minor Groove Binder) probe technique which consists of the use of the allelic discrimination with the Taqman method.

We also explored whether associations varied by smoking, by family history or clinical features of prostate cancer.\nThere were no associations between these SNPs and overall risk of prostate cancer. Risks by genotype also did not vary by smoking or by family history of prostate cancer. Although two SNPs in BRCA2 (rs144848, rs1801406) and two SNPs in ERCC2 (rs1799793, rs13181) showed stronger associations with high Gleason score or advanced-stage tumors when comparing homozygous men carrying the minor versus major allele, results were not statistically significantly different between clinically aggressive and non-aggressive tumors.\nOverall, this study found no associations between prostate cancer and the SNPs in DNA repair genes. Given the complexity of this pathway and its crucial role in maintenance of genomic stability, a pathway-based analysis of all 150 genes in DNA repair pathways, as well as exploration of gene-environment interactions may be warranted."}

In addition, we carried out the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) with the same polymorphisms from a sample of 81 trios (i.e., 81 patients included in the case-control study and their both parents).\nThe case-control study revealed no significant association between CDH and the tagSNPs selected in both HOXB9 and COL1A1. Moreover, the TDT did not reveal distortion in allelic and haplotype transmission of the studied markers.\nOur study did not support an association between HOXB9 and COL1A1 and CDH in our population.

High-resolution melting curve analysis (hrMCA) has recently been developed as a post-PCR mutation scanning method which enables simple, rapid, cost-effective, and highly sensitive mutation screening of large genes. We established a hrMCA method to screen for COL3A1 mutations using genomic DNA. PCR primers pairs for COL3A1 (52 amplicons) were designed to cover all coding regions of the 52 exons, including the splicing sites. We used 15 DNA samples (8 validation samples and 7 samples of clinically suspected vEDS patients) in this study. The eight known COL3A1 mutations in validation samples were all successfully detected by the hrMCA. In addition, we identified five novel COL3A1 mutations, including one deletion (c.2187delA) and one nonsense mutation (c.2992C>T) that could not be determined by the conventional total RNA method. Furthermore, we established a small amplicon genotyping (SAG) method for detecting three high frequency coding-region SNPs (rs1800255:G>A, rs1801184:T>C, and rs2271683:A>G) in COL3A1 to differentiate mutations before sequencing. The use of hrMCA in combination with SAG from genomic DNA enables rapid detection of COL3A1 mutations with high efficiency and specificity. A better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in COL3A1 using this method will lead to improve in diagnosis and treatment."}

No significant difference was observed between fracture and control groups with respect to allele frequency or genotype distribution in 9 selected SNPs and haplotype. No significant association was found between fragility fracture and each SNP or haplotype. The results remained the same after additional corrections for other risk factors such as weight, height, and bone mineral density.\nOur results show no association between common genetic variations of COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes and fracture, suggesting the complex genetic background of osteoporotic fractures."}

Furthermore, the common non-synonymous COL11A1 SNP rs1676486 is associated with another degenerative musculoskeletal disease, lumbar disc herniation (LDH). rs1676486 is a C-T transition mediating its affect on LDH susceptibility by modulating COL11A1 expression. The risk T-allele of rs1676486 leads to reduced expression of the COL11A1 transcript, a phenomenon known as allelic expression imbalance (AEI). We were keen therefore to assess whether the effect that rs1676486 has on COL11A1 expression in LDH is also observed in OA and whether the rs2615977 association to OA also marked AEI.\nUsing RNA from OA cartilage, we assessed whether either SNP correlated with COL11A1 AEI by 1) measuring COL11A1 expression and stratifying the data by genotype at each SNP; and 2) quantifying the mRNA transcribed from each allele of the two SNPs. We also assessed whether rs1676486 was associated with OA susceptibility using a case-control cohort of over 18,000 individuals.\nWe observed significant AEI at rs1676486 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) with the T-allele correlating with reduced COL11A1 expression. This corresponded with observations in LDH but the SNP was not associated with OA. We did not observe AEI at rs2615977.\nCOL11A1 is subject to AEI in OA cartilage. AEI at rs1676486 is a risk factor for LDH, but not for OA. These two diseases therefore share a common functional phenotype, namely AEI of COL11A1, but this appears to be a disease risk only in LDH. Other functional effects on COL11A1 presumably account for the OA susceptibility that maps to this gene."}

Severe hereditary impairment of NER leads to cancers such as those in xeroderma pigmentosum, and more moderate reductions in NER capacity have been associated with an increased cancer risk. Diet is a proven modifier of cancer risk but few studies have investigated the potential relationships between diet and NER. In the present study, the plasmid-based host cell reactivation assay was used to measure the NER capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from fifty-seven volunteers aged 18-30 years before and after 6 weeks of supplementation with micronutrients (selenium and vitamins A, C and E). As a control, nine individuals remained unsupplemented over the same period. Volunteers were genotyped for the following polymorphisms in NER genes: ERCC5 Asp1104His (rs17655); XPC Lys939Gln (rs2228001); ERCC2 Lys751Gnl (rs13181); XPC PAT (an 83 bp poly A/T insertion-deletion polymorphism in the XPC gene). NER capacity varied 11-fold between individuals and was inversely associated with age and endogenous DNA strand breaks. For the first time, we observed an inverse association between adiposity and NER. No single polymorphism was associated with the NER capacity, although significant gene-gene interactions were observed between XPC Lys939Gln and ERCC5 Asp1104His and XPC Lys939Gln and ERCC2 Lys751Gnl. While there was no detectable effect of micronutrient supplementation on NER capacity, there was evidence that the effect of fruit intake on the NER capacity may be modulated by the ERCC2 Lys751Gnl single nucleotide polymorphism."}

Molecular genetic information is invaluable for an accurate clinical diagnosis of RP due to its high genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Using a gene capture panel that covers 163 of the currently known retinal disease genes, including 48 RP genes, we performed a comprehensive molecular screening in a collection of 123 RP unsettled probands from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds, including 113 unrelated simplex and 10 autosomal recessive RP (arRP) cases. As a result, 61 mutations were identified in 45 probands, including 38 novel pathogenic alleles. Interestingly, we observed that phenotype and genotype were not in full agreement in 21 probands. Among them, eight probands were clinically reassessed, resulting in refinement of clinical diagnoses for six of these patients. Finally, recessive mutations in CLN3 were identified in five retinal degeneration patients, including four RP probands and one cone-rod dystrophy patient, suggesting that CLN3 is a novel non-syndromic retinal disease gene. Collectively, our results underscore that, due to the high molecular and clinical heterogeneity of RP, comprehensive screening of all retinal disease genes is effective in identifying novel pathogenic mutations and provides an opportunity to discover new genotype-phenotype correlations. Information gained from this genetic screening will directly aid in patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, as well as allowing appropriate family planning and counseling."}

We performed cosegregation analysis of VUS with cancer in families, evaluated their frequency in unaffected controls, and looked for loss of heterozygosity in tumors. In addition, three different bioinformatic algorithms were used (Interactive Biosoftware, ESEfinder, and PolyPhen). Finally, six VUS located in exon-intron boundaries were analyzed by RT-PCR. We found that seven variants segregated with the disease, six variants co-occurred with a pathogenic mutation in the same gene, and four variants co-occurred with a deleterious mutation in the other BRCA gene. By RT-PCR, we observed that four variants (BRCA1 c.4484G>T, BRCA2 c.682-2A>C, BRCA2 c.8488-1G>A, and BRCA2 c.8954-5A>G) disrupted splicing. After the combined analysis, we were able to classify 4 splicing variants as pathogenic mutations, 16 variants as neutral, and 3 variants as polymorphisms; only 2 variants remained classified as VUS.

The discovery phase was followed by a replication in an independent set of 1,374 cases and controls of European ancestry. We applied a generalized linear model with single nucleotide polymorphisms as predictors and DRC (a continuous variable) as the outcome. Covariates of age, sex, pack-years of smoking, DRC assay-related variables, and case-control status of the study participants were adjusted in the model. We validated that reduced DRC was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in both independent datasets. Several suggestive loci that contributed to the DRC phenotype were defined in ERCC2/XPD, PHACTR2, and DUSP1. In summary, we determined that DRC is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, and we defined several genetic loci contributing to DRC phenotype."}

As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final \"maintenance\" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, encoded by the SCN family of genes. Phenytoin is principally metabolized by CYP2C9, and both are probable substrates of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of carbamazepine and phenytoin in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in CYP2C9 is highly associated with the maximum dose of phenytoin (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the SCN1A gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both carbamazepine and phenytoin (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of phenytoin and carbamazepine. Although the case made here is compelling, our results cannot be considered definitive or ready for clinical application until they are confirmed by independent replication."}

Most of these studies have been restricted to evaluations of specific SNPs within a single gene and within populations from European ancestry. Recently, there is increasing interest in understanding racial differences in genetic risk associated with childhood asthma. Our aim was to compare association patterns of asthma candidate genes between children of European and African ancestry.\nUsing a custom-designed Illumina SNP array, we genotyped 1,485 children within the Greater Cincinnati Pediatric Clinic Repository and Cincinnati Genomic Control Cohort for 259 SNPs in 28 genes and evaluated their associations with asthma. We identified 14 SNPs located in 6 genes that were significantly associated (p-values <0.05) with childhood asthma in African Americans. Among Caucasians, 13 SNPs in 5 genes were associated with childhood asthma. Two SNPs in IL4 were associated with asthma in both races (p-values <0.05). Gene-gene interaction studies identified race specific sets of genes that best discriminate between asthmatic children and non-allergic controls.\nWe identified IL4 as having a role in asthma susceptibility in both African American and Caucasian children. However, while IL4 SNPs were associated with asthma in asthmatic children with European and African ancestry, the relative contributions of the most replicated asthma-associated SNPs varied by ancestry. These data provides valuable insights into the pathways that may predispose to asthma in individuals with European vs. African ancestry."}

Here are reported the separation of wild type mutant homoduplexes from wild type/mutant heteroduplexes for 27 randomly chosen target sequences without any laboratory optimization steps. Calculation of the equilibrium melting map of each target sequence attached to a high melting domain (clamp) was sufficient to design the analyte sequence and predict the expected degree of resolution.\nCTCE provides practical means for economical pangenomic detection and enumeration of point mutations in large-scale human case/control cohort studies. We estimate that the combined reagent, instrumentation and labor costs for scanning the approximately 250,000 exons and splice sites of the approximately 25,000 human protein-coding genes using automated CTCE instruments in 100 case cohorts of 10,000 individuals each are now less than U.S. $500 million, less than U.S. $500 per person."}

Here we describe the identification of a novel gene predisposing specifically to seminoma formation in a vertebrate model organism. Zebrafish carrying a heterozygous nonsense mutation in Leucine-Rich Repeat Containing protein 50 (lrrc50 also called dnaaf1), associated previously with ciliary function, are found to be highly susceptible to the formation of seminomas. Genotyping of these zebrafish tumors shows loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type lrrc50 allele in 44.4% of tumor samples, correlating with tumor progression. In humans we identified heterozygous germline LRRC50 mutations in two different pedigrees with a family history of seminomas, resulting in a nonsense Arg488* change and a missense Thr590Met change, which show reduced expression of the wild-type allele in seminomas. Zebrafish in vivo complementation studies indicate the Thr590Met to be a loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, we show that a pathogenic Gln307Glu change is significantly enriched in individuals with seminoma tumors (13% of our cohort). Together, our study introduces an animal model for seminoma and suggests LRRC50 to be a novel tumor suppressor implicated in human seminoma pathogenesis."}

The common practice of analyzing one SNP at a time does not fully realize the potential of GWAS to identify multiple causal variants and to predict risk of disease. Existing methods for joint analysis of GWAS data tend to miss causal SNPs that are marginally uncorrelated with disease and have high false discovery rates (FDRs).\nWe introduce GWASelect, a statistically powerful and computationally efficient variable selection method designed to tackle the unique challenges of GWAS data. This method searches iteratively over the potential SNPs conditional on previously selected SNPs and is thus capable of capturing causal SNPs that are marginally correlated with disease as well as those that are marginally uncorrelated with disease. A special resampling mechanism is built into the method to reduce false positive findings. Simulation studies demonstrate that the GWASelect performs well under a wide spectrum of linkage disequilibrium patterns and can be substantially more powerful than existing methods in capturing causal variants while having a lower FDR. In addition, the regression models based on the GWASelect tend to yield more accurate prediction of disease risk than existing methods. The advantages of the GWASelect are illustrated with the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) data.\nThe software implementing GWASelect is available at http://www.bios.unc.edu/~lin.

Significant risk effects of Asp(312)Asn polymorphism on bladder susceptibility were observed in all subjects under all genetic contrasts, however, stratified analyses showed that the (312)Asn allele showed different risk effects in USA and Caucasian. The Gln/Gln genotype acts as a risk factor in its association with bladder cancer, and the effect of Lys(751)Gln polymorphism on bladder susceptibility should be studied with larger, stratified population; the (312)Asn allele has an important role in the etiology of bladder cancer whereas the ethnic background should be carefully concerned in further studies."}

This intuitively appealing idea provides the rationale for a large number of studies that have attracted much attention from scientists, clinicians and the general public. Unfortunately, most of this work presupposes that a functional effect has been established for the DNA repair gene polymorphisms under study. For XPD, there is no credible evidence for any effect on DNA repair of the two common polymorphisms leading to p.D312N and p.K751Q amino acid variations, and evolutionary analyses strongly predict that both polymorphisms are benign. Current evidence suggests no causal relationship between XPD polymorphisms, reduced DNA repair and increased cancer risk. We do not believe that more studies of the same kind will be useful. Instead, we suggest a combination of several other approaches, which up to now have been used in only a sporadic way, to examine more rigorously the possibility that phenotypic differences are associated with polymorphisms in other DNA repair genes."}

We explored the 2-Mb region around MSX1, using a marker map of 393 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 297 cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, case-parent trios and 84 cleft palate trios from Maryland, Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea. Both individual markers and haplotypes of two to five SNPs showed several regions yielding statistical evidence for linkage and disequilibrium. Two genes (STK32B and EVC) yielded consistent evidence from cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, trios in all four populations. These two genes plus EVC2 also yielded suggestive evidence for linkage and disequilibrium among cleft palate trios. This analysis suggests that several genes, not just MSX1, in this region may influence risk of oral clefts."}

All the identified CCA mutations in FBN2 cluster in a limited region similar to where severe MFS mutations cluster in FBN1, specifically between exons 23 and 34. We screened exons 22 through 36 of FBN2 for mutations in 13 patients with classic CCA by single stranded conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and then by direct sequencing. We successfully identified 10 novel mutations in this critical region of FBN2 in these patients, indicating a mutation detection rate of 75% in this limited region. Interestingly, none of these identified FBN2 mutations alter amino acids in the calcium binding consensus sequence in the EGF-like domains, whereas many of the FBN1 mutations alter the consensus sequence. Furthermore, analysis of the clinical data of the CCA patients with characterized FBN2 mutation indicate that CCA patients have aortic root dilatation and the vast majority lack evidence of congenital heart disease.

Conversely, genetic variants should not be related to the confounding factors that distort associations in conventional observational epidemiological studies. Furthermore, disease onset will not influence genotype. Therefore, it has been suggested that genetic variants that are known to be associated with a modifiable (nongenetic) risk factor can be used to help determine the causal effect of this modifiable risk factor on disease outcomes. This approach, mendelian randomization, is increasingly being applied within epidemiological studies. However, there is debate about the underlying premise that associations between genotypes and disease outcomes are not confounded by other risk factors. We examined the extent to which genetic variants, on the one hand, and nongenetic environmental exposures or phenotypic characteristics on the other, tend to be associated with each other, to assess the degree of confounding that would exist in conventional epidemiological studies compared with mendelian randomization studies.\nWe estimated pairwise correlations between nongenetic baseline variables and genetic variables in a cross-sectional study comparing the number of correlations that were statistically significant at the 5%, 1%, and 0.01% level (alpha = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001, respectively) with the number expected by chance if all variables were in fact uncorrelated, using a two-sided binomial exact test. We demonstrate that behavioural, socioeconomic, and physiological factors are strongly interrelated, with 45% of all possible pairwise associations between 96 nongenetic characteristics (n = 4,560 correlations) being significant at the p < 0.01 level (the ratio of observed to expected significant associations was 45; p-value for difference between observed and expected < 0.000001). Similar findings were observed for other levels of significance. In contrast, genetic variants showed no greater association with each other, or with the 96 behavioural, socioeconomic, and physiological factors, than would be expected by chance.\nThese data illustrate why observational studies have produced misleading claims regarding potentially causal factors for disease. The findings demonstrate the potential power of a methodology that utilizes genetic variants as indicators of exposure level when studying environmentally modifiable risk factors."}

We aimed at analyzing whether 7 different common variants in genes coding for 2 key members of the TGF-beta signalling pathway (TGFB1 and TGFBR1) are associated with bladder cancer risk and prognosis. A total of 1,157 cases with urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder and 1,157 matched controls where genotyped for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFB1 (rs1982073, rs1800472, rs1800471) and an additional 3 SNPs and 1 indel polymorphism in TGFBR1 (rs868, rs928180, rs334358 and rs11466445, respectively). In the case-control study, we estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each individual genetic variant using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, study area and smoking status. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox models. The endpoints of interest were tumor relapse, progression and death from bladder cancer. All the SNPs analyzed showed a similar distribution among cases and controls. The distribution of the TGFBR1*6A allele (rs11466445) was also similar among cases and controls, indicating no association with bladder cancer risk. Similarly, none of the haplotypes was significantly associated with bladder cancer risk. Among patients with muscle-invasive tumors, we found a significant association between TGFBR1-rs868 and disease-specific mortality with an allele dosage effect (p-trend=0.003). In conclusion, the genetic variants analyzed were not associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. The association of TGFBR1-rs868 with outcome should be validated in independent patient series."}

However, there are few examples in which common variation in genes causing a Mendelian neuropsychiatric disorder has been shown to contribute to disease susceptibility in an allied common condition. Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare recessively inherited disorder, with mutations reported at several loci including the gene Abelson's Helper Integration 1 (AHI1). A significant proportion of patients with JS, in some studies up to 40%, have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and several linkage studies in ASD have nominally implicated the region on 6q where AHI1 resides. To evaluate AHI1 in ASD, we performed a three-stage analysis of AHI1 as an a priori candidate gene for autism. Re-sequencing was first used to screen AHI1, followed by two subsequent association studies, one limited and one covering the gene more completely, in Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) families. In stage 3, we found evidence of an associated haplotype in AHI1 with ASD after correction for multiple comparisons, in a region of the gene that had been previously associated with schizophrenia. These data suggest a role for AHI1 in common disorders affecting human cognition and behavior."}

These texts commonly describe variations using natural language; database identifiers are seldom mentioned. This complicates the retrieval of variations, associated articles, as well as information extraction, e. g. the search for biological implications. To overcome these challenges, procedures to map textual mentions of variations to database identifiers need to be developed.\nThis article describes a workflow for normalization of variation mentions, i.e. the association of them to unique database identifiers. Common pitfalls in the interpretation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mentions are highlighted and discussed. The developed normalization procedure achieves a precision of 98.1 % and a recall of 67.5% for unambiguous association of variation mentions with dbSNP identifiers on a text corpus based on 296 MEDLINE abstracts containing 527 mentions of SNPs. The annotated corpus is freely available at http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/snp-normalization-corpus.html.\nComparable approaches usually focus on variations mentioned on the protein sequence and neglect problems for other SNP mentions. The results presented here indicate that normalizing SNPs described on DNA level is more difficult than the normalization of SNPs described on protein level. The challenges associated with normalization are exemplified with ambiguities and errors, which occur in this corpus."}

A meta-analysis has implicated transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1) as a contributor to disease susceptibility.\nWe have examined previously reported associations in both genes in a collection of 1017 white COPD patients and 912 non-diseased smoking controls. Genotype information was obtained for seven SNPs in the IREB2 gene, and for four SNPs in the TGFbeta1 gene. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between COPD cases and controls, and odds ratios were calculated. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, smoking and centre, including interactions of age, sex and smoking with centre.\nOur data replicate the association of IREB2 SNPs in association with COPD for SNP rs2568494, rs2656069 and rs12593229 with respective adjusted p-values of 0.0018, 0.0039 and 0.0053.

Twin and sibling analysis indicates that modifier genes, rather than allelic variation in CFTR, are responsible for most of the variability in severity of lung disease, the major cause of mortality in CF patients. We used a family-based approach to test for association between lung function and two functional SNPs (rs1800469, '-509' and rs1982073, 'codon 10') in the 5' region of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1), a putative CF modifier gene. Quantitative transmission disequilibrium testing of 472 CF patient-parent-parent trios revealed that both TGFB1 SNPs showed significant transmission distortion when patients were stratified by CFTR genotype. Although lung function and nutritional status are correlated in CF patients, there was no evidence of association between the TGFB1 SNPs and variation in nutritional status. Additional tagging SNPs (rs8179181, rs2278422, rs8110090, rs4803455 and rs1982072) that capture most of the diversity in TGFB1 were also typed but none showed association with variation in lung function. However, a haplotype composed of the -509 C and codon 10 T alleles along with the C allele of the 3' SNP rs8179181 was highly associated with increased lung function in patients grouped by CFTR genotype. These results demonstrate that TGFB1 is a modifier of CF lung disease and reveal a previously unrecognized beneficial effect of TGFB1 variants upon the pulmonary phenotype."}

One kindred, of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, had five members who were diagnosed with breast cancer and two cousins who were BRCA2*6174delT/C3069X compound heterozygotes and had Fanconi anemia and brain tumors.

Blood samples from 180 blood donors served as another control group. Genotyping was carried out on genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Plasma TGF-beta(1) was measured by commercially available ELISA kit. We found no differences in the distribution of genotypes or alleles of TGF-beta(1) gene polymorphisms at C-509T and T869C between patients and either group of healthy controls. Patients with TB had elevated plasma TGF-beta(1) levels compared with healthy controls irrespective of their genotypes (p<0.001).

Some genes have been shown to affect several immune-mediated diseases. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that alleles of susceptibility genes previously associated with other immune-mediated diseases might perturb immune homeostasis, and hence also associate with predisposition to T1D.\nWe resequenced and genotyped tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from two genes, CRP and FCER1B, and genotyped 27 disease-associated polymorphisms from thirteen gene regions, namely FCRL3, CFH, SLC9A3R1, PADI4, RUNX1, SPINK5, IL1RN, IL1RA, CARD15, IBD5-locus (including SLC22A4), LAG3, ADAM33 and NFKB1. These genes have been associated previously with susceptibility to a range of immune-mediated diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Graves' disease (GD), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PA), atopy, asthma, Crohn disease and multiple sclerosis (MS). Our T1D collections are divided into three sample subsets, consisting of set 1 families (up to 754 families), set 2 families (up to 743 families), and a case-control collection (ranging from 1,500 to 4,400 cases and 1,500 to 4,600 controls). Each SNP was genotyped in one or more of these subsets. Our study typically had approximately 80% statistical power for a minor allele frequency (MAF) >5% and odds ratios (OR) of 1.5 with the type 1 error rate, alpha = 0.05.\nWe found no evidence of association with T1D at most of the loci studied 0.02 <P < 1.0. Only a SNP in ADAM33, rs2787094, was any evidence of association obtained, P = 0.0004 in set 1 families (relative risk (RR) = 0.78), but further support was not observed in the 4,326 cases and 4,610 controls, P = 0.57 (OR = 1.02).\nPolymorphisms in a variety of genes previously associated with immune-mediated disease susceptibility and/or having effects on gene function and the immune system, are unlikely to be affecting T1D susceptibility in a major way, even though some of the genes tested encode proteins of immune pathways that are believed to be central to the development of T1D. We cannot, however, rule out effect sizes smaller than OR 1.5."}

In this study we performed a follow-up analysis of TGFB1 by sequencing the complete exon 1 in European and by genotyping previously described positively associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Japanese patients with MMD.\nThe complete first exon of TGFB1 was genotyped in 40 MMD patients and 68 healthy controls from central Europe.

The previously described disease association of rs1800471 and tendency toward significance of rs1800470 could not be replicated in the Japanese cohort.\nAs no new genetic variants were uncovered in this study of the first exon of TGFB1 in European MMD patients and because of the negative association of rs1800470 and rs1800471 in Japanese MMD patients, a role of this exon of TGFB1 in the genesis of MMD is unlikely.

Sanger sequencing of 276 probands from families with inherited thoracic aortic disease identified 2 additional TGFB2 mutations.

PLP is a metabolically-active form of vitamin B(6) and thus, is required as a co-factor for enzymes involved in both homocysteine metabolism and synthesis of neurotransmitters such as catecholamine. We examined 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PNPO and its 5'-flanking regions in 359 schizophrenia patients and 582 control subjects.

A second locus on chromosome 2q, GEFS2, was recently identified as the sodium-channel alpha1-subunit, SCN1A. Single-stranded conformation analysis (SSCA) of SCN1A was performed in 53 unrelated index cases to estimate the frequency of mutations in patients with GEFS+. No mutations were found in 17 isolated cases of GEFS+. Three novel SCN1A mutations-D188V, V1353L, and I1656M-were found in 36 familial cases; of the remaining 33 families, 3 had mutations in SCN1B. On the basis of SSCA, the combined frequency of SCN1A and SCN1B mutations in familial cases of GEFS+ was found to be 17%."}

To assess the contribution that SCN1A makes to other types of epilepsy, 226 patients with either juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, absence epilepsy, or febrile convulsions were screened by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and manual sequencing of variants; the sample included 165 probands from multiplex families and 61 sporadic cases. The novel mutation W1204R was identified in a family with GEFS+. Seven other coding changes were observed; three of these are potential disease-causing mutations. Two common haplotypes, with frequencies of .67 and .33, were defined by five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 14-kb region of linkage disequilibrium. An SNP located 18 bp upstream of the splice-acceptor site for exon 3 was observed in 7 of the 226 patients but was not present in 185 controls, suggesting possible association with a disease mutation. This work has confirmed the role of SCN1A in GEFS+, by identification of a novel mutation in a previously undescribed family. Although a few candidate disease alleles were identified, the patient survey suggests that SCN1A is not a major contributor to idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The SCN1A haplotypes and SNPs identified here will be useful in future association and linkage studies."}

Considering the prominent role of IL-10 and TGF-B1 as regulators of the inflammatory process and vascular physiology, the aim of the present study was to analyze whether IL-10 and TGF-B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with SMI. The IL-10-1082 A>G (rs1800896), IL-10-819 T>C (rs1800871), IL-10-592 A>C (rs1800872), TGF-\u03b21-509 T>C (rs1800469), and TGF-\u03b21 T29C (rs1800470) SNPs were analyzed by 5'exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 149 SMI patients and 248 healthy controls. The IL-10-1082 A>G (rs1800896) SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of SMI as compared to controls under both dominant and heterozygous models (OR=1.77, Pdom=0.029 and OR=1.69, PHet=0.043).

We have analysed genotyping data at seven microsatellite loci and four single nucleotide polymorphisms targeting the 19q13 area from 37 nuclear CF families with two affected offspring exhibiting extreme clinical phenotypes for indicators of transmission-ration distortion, maternal genetic or maternal non-genetic effects. Evidence for a transmission-ratio distortion was obtained at D19S112 (P=0.0304) near the recently characterised myotonic dystrophy locus myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK). Maternal and paternal genotype distributions were significantly different at rs1982073 (Leu10Pro at TGFbeta1) whereby all CF sibs heterozygous at rs1982073 inherited the Leu10 allele from their mother (P=0.000132) in our sibling panel. To ask whether the improved survival in CF over the last decades has any influence on TGFbeta1 allele frequencies, we analysed unrelated F508del homozygotes who were stratified by birth cohort. Sensitivity with respect to the survivor bias was reflected by significantly higher incidence of mild cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutation genotypes in the early born patient cohort (P=0.0169), and an allelic imbalance was also observed at TGFbeta1 (P=0.0664). In conclusion, the role of TGFbeta1 as a CF modulator, suggested from studies with a case-control setting, needs to be interpreted with caution unless family-based analysis is carried out to identify parental genetic and non-genetic effects."}

{"title": "American Society of Clinical Oncology policy statement update: genetic testing for cancer susceptibility.", "journal": "J. Clin. Oncol.: 21(12), 2397-406.", "authors": "American Society of Clinical Oncology", "pubmed_id": 12692171, "year": "2003", "abstract": "As the leading organization representing cancer specialists involved in patient care and clinical research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) reaffirms its commitment to integrating cancer risk assessment and management, including molecular analysis of cancer predisposition genes, into the practice of oncology and preventive medicine. The primary goal of this effort is to foster expanded access to, and continued advances in, medical care provided to patients and families affected by hereditary cancer syndromes. The 1996 ASCO Statement on Genetic Testing for Cancer Susceptibility set forth specific recommendations relating to clinical practice, research needs, educational opportunities, requirement for informed consent, indications for genetic testing, regulation of laboratories, and protection from discrimination, as well as access to and reimbursement for cancer genetics services. In updating this Statement, ASCO endorses the following principles: Indications for Genetic Testing: ASCO recommends that genetic testing be offered when 1) the individual has personal or family history features suggestive of a genetic cancer susceptibility condition, 2) the test can be adequately interpreted, and 3) the results will aid in diagnosis or influence the medical or surgical management of the patient or family members at hereditary risk of cancer. ASCO recommends that genetic testing only be done in the setting of pre- and post-test counseling, which should include discussion of possible risks and benefits of cancer early detection and prevention modalities. Special Issues in Testing Children for Cancer Susceptibility: ASCO recommends that the decision to offer testing to potentially affected children should take into account the availability of evidence-based risk-reduction strategies and the probability of developing a malignancy during childhood. Where risk-reduction strategies are available or cancer predominantly develops in childhood, ASCO believes that the scope of parental authority encompasses the right to decide for or against testing. In the absence of increased risk of a childhood malignancy, ASCO recommends delaying genetic testing until an individual is of sufficient age to make an informed decision regarding such tests. As in other areas of pediatric care, the clinical cancer genetics professional should be an advocate for the best interests of the child. Counseling About Medical Management After Testing: ASCO recommends that oncologists include in pre- and post-test counseling the discussion of possible risks and benefits of cancer early-detection and prevention modalities, some of which have presumed but unproven efficacy for individuals at increased hereditary risk of cancer. Regulation of Genetic Testing: ASCO recommends strengthening regulatory oversight of laboratories that provide clinical cancer predisposition tests. These quality assurance mechanisms should include oversight of the reagents used in genetic testing, interlaboratory comparisons of reference samples, standardization of laboratory genetic test reports, and proficiency testing. Protection From Insurance and Employment Discrimination: ASCO supports establishing a federal law to prohibit discrimination by health insurance providers and employers on the basis of an individual's inherited susceptibility to cancer. Protections against genetic discrimination should apply to those with group coverage, those with individual health insurance policies, and the uninsured. Coverage of Services: ASCO supports efforts to ensure that all individuals at significantly increased risk of hereditary cancer have access to appropriate genetic counseling, testing, screening, surveillance, and all related medical and surgical interventions, which should be covered without penalty by public and private third-party payers. Confidentiality and Communication of Familial Risk: ASCO recommends that providers make concerted efforts to protect the confidentiality of genetic information. However, they should remind patients of the importance of communicating test results to family members, as part of pretest counseling and informed consent discussions. ASCO believes that the cancer care provider's obligations (if any) to at-risk relatives are best fulfilled by communication of familial risk to the person undergoing testing, emphasizing the importance of sharing this information with family members so that they may also benefit. Educational Opportunities in Genetics: ASCO is committed to continuing to provide educational opportunities for physicians and other health care providers regarding the methods of cancer risk assessment, the clinical characteristics of hereditary cancer susceptibility syndromes, and the range of issues related to genetic testing, including pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and risk management, so that health professionals may responsibly integrate the care of persons at increased genetic risk of cancer into the practice of clinical and preventive oncology. Special Issues Relating to Genetic Research on Human Tissues:ASCO recommends that all researchers proposing to use or store human biologic specimens for genetic studies should consult either the responsible institutional review board (IRB) or a comparable body specifically constituted to assess human tissue research, to determine the requirements for protection specific to the study under consideration. This consultation should take place before the project is initiated. The determination of the need for informed consent or authorization in such studies should depend on whether the research involves tests for genetic markers of known clinical significance and whether research data will be linked to protected health information, as well as other considerations specific to the study proposed. Special attention should also be paid to 1) whether future research findings will be disclosed to the research participants, 2) whether future contact of participants is planned, 3) whether and how protected health information about the tissue donors will be stored, and what will happen to study specimens after the trial ends. In addition, ASCO affirms the right of people contributing tissue to a databank to rescind their permission, in accordance with federal privacy regulations."}

In contrast, the genetic basis of allergic rhinitis (AR) has not been evaluated as extensively. It is well known that asthma is closely related with AR since a large proportion of individuals with asthma also present symptoms of AR, and patients with AR have a 5-6 fold increased risk of developing asthma. Thus, the relevance of asthma candidate genes as predisposing factors for AR is worth investigating. The present study was designed to investigate if SNPs in highly replicated asthma genes are associated with the occurrence of AR.\nA total of 192 SNPs from 21 asthma candidate genes reported to be associated with asthma in 6 or more unrelated studies were genotyped in a Swedish population with 246 AR patients and 431 controls. Genotypes for 429 SNPs from the same set of genes were also extracted from a Singapore Chinese genome-wide dataset which consisted of 456 AR cases and 486 controls. All SNPs were subsequently analyzed for association with AR and their influence on allergic sensitization to common allergens.\nA limited number of potential associations were observed and the overall pattern of P-values corresponds well to the expectations in the absence of an effect. However, in the tests of allele effects in the Chinese population the number of significant P-values exceeds the expectations. The strongest signals were found for SNPs in NPSR1 and CTLA4. In these genes, a total of nine SNPs showed P-values <0.001 with corresponding Q-values <0.05. In the NPSR1 gene some P-values were lower than the Bonferroni correction level. Reanalysis after elimination of all patients with asthmatic symptoms excluded asthma as a confounding factor in our results. Weaker indications were found for IL13 and GSTP1 with respect to sensitization to birch pollen in the Swedish population.\nGenetic variation in the majority of the highly replicated asthma genes were not associated to AR in our populations which suggest that asthma and AR could have less in common than previously anticipated. However, NPSR1 and CTLA4 can be genetic links between AR and asthma and associations of polymorphisms in NPSR1 with AR have not been reported previously."}

We selected 160 expressed candidate genes that are involved in cancer and anticancer drug resistance for analysis of AI in a panel of cell lines that represent different types of cancers and have been well characterized for their response patterns against anticancer drugs. Of these genes, 60 contained heterozygous SNPs in their coding regions, and 41 of the genes displayed imbalanced expression of the two cSNP alleles. Genes that displayed AI were subjected to bioinformatics-assisted identification of rSNPs that alter the strength of transcription factor binding. rSNPs in 15 genes were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and in eight of these genes (APC, BCL2, CCND2, MLH1, PARP1, SLIT2, YES1, XRCC1) we identified differential protein binding from a nuclear extract between the SNP alleles. The screening process allowed us to zoom in from 160 candidate genes to eight genes that may contain functional rSNPs in their promoter regions."}

Healthy blood donors (n=75) served as controls.\nthe polymorphisms of TGF-beta1 +869 T--> C and IL-8 -251 T-->A were determined by the ARMS method, while that of TNF-alpha -308 was investigated using NcoI RFLP.\nthere was a higher frequency (50%) of the TT genotype of TGF-beta1 +869, with a concomitantly higher TGF-beta1 level in the plasma (5.2 +/- 1.7 ng/mL) of patients with chronic pancreatitis than in healthy blood donors (28% and 2.8 +/- 0.9 ng/mL respectively). The number of TT homozygotes differed significantly between the patients who underwent surgical intervention and the controls, and even between the surgical and the non-surgical patients. The frequency of the T/A genotype with higher IL-8 production, was significantly higher in both groups of patients than in the controls (58% and 58% versus 40%). No correlation was found between the TNF-alpha -308 polymorphism and chronic pancreatitis.\ncorrelations of the TGF-beta1 and IL-8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with chronic pancreatitis underline the importance of these cytokines in the pathomechanism of the disease. Moreover, it seems that the TT genotype of +869 TGF-beta1 might be a risk factor for the development of a severe form of chronic pancreatitis, and could serve as a prognostic sign for any future surgical intervention or even repeat surgery. Further studies on a larger group of patients, in addition to a follow-up study, are necessary to confirm this preliminary observation."}

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing that emphasized the importance of alerting the patient to the possibility of such results in pretest patient discussions, clinical testing, and reporting of results. The ACMG appointed a Working Group on Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing to make recommendations about responsible management of incidental findings when patients undergo exome or genome sequencing. This Working Group conducted a year-long consensus process, including an open forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting and review by outside experts, and produced recommendations that have been approved by the ACMG Board. Specific and detailed recommendations, and the background and rationale for these recommendations, are described herein. The ACMG recommends that laboratories performing clinical sequencing seek and report mutations of the specified classes or types in the genes listed here. This evaluation and reporting should be performed for all clinical germline (constitutional) exome and genome sequencing, including the \"normal\" of tumor-normal subtractive analyses in all subjects, irrespective of age but excluding fetal samples. We recognize that there are insufficient data on penetrance and clinical utility to fully support these recommendations, and we encourage the creation of an ongoing process for updating these recommendations at least annually as further data are collected."}

Univariate Cox proportional hazards model analyses revealed that ERCC5 (XPG) 1104 His/His was significantly associated with impaired survival. Indeed, the univariate hazard ratio (HR) was 2.8 times higher for patients with ERCC5 1104 His/His (P<0.001) compared with ERCC5 1104 Asp/Asp. Accordingly, the 5-year survival rate was 55% (95% confidence interval 43-71) for patients with ERCC5 1104 His/His, whereas 82% (95% confidence interval 78-86) of patients with ERCC5 1104 Asp/Asp were still alive at this time. Importantly, adjusted Cox regression analysis not only confirmed ERCC5 1104 His/His as an independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR=4.5; P<0.001), but also revealed the significant impact of ERCC2 (XPD) 751 Gln/Gln on prognosis, with a 2.2-fold increased HR compared with ERCC2 751 Lys/Lys (P=0.009).

India harbors enormous genetic, cultural and linguistic diversity. The present study was undertaken to determine the allele and genotype frequencies of four non-synonymous SNPs, XRCC1 Arg399Gln (C>T, rs25487), XRCC3 Thr241Met (G>A, rs861539), XPD Lys751Gln (T>G, rs13181), and OGG1 Ser326Cys (C>G, rs1052133) in the Maharashtrian population, residing in the Vidarbha region of central India and to compare them with HapMap and other Indian populations. The variant alleles of these polymorphisms have been found to be positively associated with different forms of cancer in several genetic epidemiological studies. The basic prevalence of these polymorphisms in the general population must be known to evaluate their significance in risk assessment in cancer and other phenotypes. About 215 healthy and unrelated individuals from the Maharashtrian population were genotyped for each of these four polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP. The allele and genotype frequency distribution at the four DNA repair gene loci among Maharashtrians revealed a characteristic pattern. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these DNA repair gene polymorphisms in a central Indian population."}

We took a pathway based candidate gene approach to investigate the possible correlation between genetic variants in Wnt pathway and tuberculosis. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Wnt pathway (rs4135385 in CTNNB1 gene, rs7832767 in SFRP1 gene, and rs11079571 in AXIN2 gene) were genotyped in 422 Chinese Han tuberculosis patients and 402 frequency matched (age, gender, and ethnicity) controls using high-resolution melting analysis. The genotype and allelic frequencies of rs4135385 and rs7832767 were significantly different among patients and controls. The dominant model of rs4135385 was significantly associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (AG/GG versus AA: OR\u200a=\u200a1.49, 95% CI\u200a=\u200a1.06-2.09, p\u200a=\u200a0.019).

Further epidemiological and functional studies in larger populations are warranted to verify our results."}

However, the characterization of a possible immune system dysregulation in MDD has been challenging. Emerging data support the role of T-cell dysfunction. Here we report the association of MDD and antidepressant response to genes important in the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune functions in Mexican Americans with major depression. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two genes critical for T-cell function are associated with susceptibility to MDD: PSMB4 (proteasome beta4 subunit), important for antigen processing, and TBX21 (T bet), critical for differentiation. Our analyses revealed a significant combined allele dose-effect: individuals who had one, two and three risk alleles were 2.3, 3.2 and 9.8 times more likely to have the diagnosis of MDD, respectively. We found associations of several SNPs and antidepressant response; those genes support the role of T cell (CD3E, PRKCH, PSMD9 and STAT3) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (UCN3) functions in treatment response. We also describe in MDD increased levels of CXCL10/IP-10, which decreased in response to antidepressants. This further suggests predominance of type 1 T-cell activity in MDD. T-cell function variations that we describe here may account for 47.8% of the attributable risk in Mexican Americans with moderate MDD. Immune function genes are highly variable; therefore, different genes might be implicated in distinct population groups."}

The authors hypothesized that the progression of breast neoplasia may differ between patients with hereditary disease and patients with nonhereditary disease and that this difference in progression may be visualized by studying the prevalence of precursor lesions and neoplastic lesions.\nThe authors developed two case cohorts of high-risk patients with a strong family history of breast carcinoma who underwent prophylactic mastectomy. The first cohort was comprised of women who underwent therapeutic mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, and the second cohort was comprised of women who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Patients without a family history of breast carcinoma who underwent unilateral or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy were selected as a control group. DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The available pathologic materials were reviewed independently by two pathologists, and all neoplastic and precursor lesions were identified and classified. Proliferation activity was assessed using MIB-1 immunohistochemistry on all available lesions from the unilateral mastectomy cohort.\nThe 28 women from the unilateral cohort with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations had a lower prevalence of proliferative fibrocystic changes (PFC) (7%) compared with their matched control group (25%) (P = 0.075) and with patients who had a family history but no BRCA1/2 mutation (22-33%). None of the 11 deleterious mutation carriers from the bilateral cohort (0%) had PFC compared with 36% of women in the matched control group (P = 0.03). There was no major difference in the prevalence of other precursor lesions (including in situ carcinoma) in either cohort. Invasive carcinomas from the deleterious mutation carriers in the unilateral cohort were of higher grade compared with the control group (P = 0.003) and patients without a mutation (P < 0.0001) but were of similar grade compared with carriers of unclassified variant BRCA1/2 alterations (P = 0.20). Neoplastic lesions from the deleterious mutation carriers in the unilateral cohort had higher MIB-1 proliferation indices compared with other patients with and without a family history of breast carcinoma.\nThe current data suggest that the progression rate of breast neoplasia is accelerated in women who carry BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations compared with other patients who have breast carcinoma with or without a family history. This increased progression rate should be taken into account when considering the surveillance of asymptomatic women."}

Since 1999 we have performed mutational screening of breast and/or ovarian cancer patients in East Denmark. During this period we have identified 40 novel sequence variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in high risk breast and/or ovarian cancer families. The mutations were detected via pre-screening using dHPLC or high-resolution melting and direct sequencing. We identified 16 variants in BRCA1, including 9 deleterious frame-shift mutations, 2 intronic variants, 4 missense mutations, and 1 synonymous variant. The remaining 24 variants were identified in BRCA2, including 10 deleterious mutants (6 frame-shift and 4 nonsense), 2 intronic variants, 10 missense mutations and 2 synonymous variants. The frequency of the variants of unknown significance was examined in control individuals. Moreover, the presumed significance of the missense mutations was predicted in silico using the align GVGD algorithm. In conclusion, the mutation screening identified 40 novel variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and thereby extends the knowledge of the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation spectrum. Nineteen of the mutations were interpreted as pathogenic, 3 missense mutations were suggested to be pathogenic based on in silico analysis, 6 mutations were suggested to be benign since they were identified in patients together with a well-known disease-causing BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation, while 12 were variants of unknown significance."}

Previous approaches have been limited in the scope of their analysis and have failed to properly incorporate the direction of allele-specific disease associations for SNPs. In this work, we refine the notion of a genetic variation profile for a given disease to capture strength of association with multiple SNPs in an allele-specific fashion. We apply this method to compare genetic variation profiles of six autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease (CD), and type 1 diabetes (T1D), as well as five non-autoimmune diseases. We quantify pair-wise relationships between these diseases and find two broad clusters of autoimmune disease where SNPs that make an individual susceptible to one class of autoimmune disease also protect from diseases in the other autoimmune class. We find that RA and AS form one such class, and MS and ATD another. We identify specific SNPs and genes with opposite risk profiles for these two classes. We furthermore explore individual SNPs that play an important role in defining similarities and differences between disease pairs. We present a novel, systematic, cross-platform approach to identify allele-specific relationships between disease pairs based on genetic variation as well as the individual SNPs which drive the relationships. While recognizing similarities between diseases might lead to identifying novel treatment options, detecting differences between diseases previously thought to be similar may point to key novel disease-specific genes and pathways."}

The study included 581 NSCLC cases and 603 healthy controls. The polymorphisms studied include XRCC1 (rs25487), hOGG1 (rs1052133), MUTYH (rs3219489) in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, XPA (rs1800975), ERCC2 (rs1799793 and rs13181) in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and XRCC3 (rs861539) in the double strand break repair (DSB) pathway.

Our findings showed that XPA -4G>A (rs1800975) had a significant association with lung cancer (OR=1.64; 95% CI: 1.03-2.60), and the association was more evident in squamous cell carcinoma (OR=1.69; 95% CI: 1.00-2.84). Three BER polymorphisms showed no independent effects on the risk of lung cancer. The stratified analysis showed higher lung cancer risk among the smokers carrying the variant XPA allele (OR=1.75; 95% CI: 1.15-2.65) and among the non-smokers carrying the variant ERCC2 allele of 312Asn (OR=2.10; 95% CI: 1.22-3.64). Meta-analysis showed that individuals with the variant AA genotype of XPA (-4G>A) had higher risk of lung cancer compared to those with the 'G' wild allele (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.12-1.47); and those with variant alleles of ERCC2 312Asn had higher risk compared to those with wild 312Asp alleles among nonsmokers (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.20-2.08). Although smoking is the dominant risk factor of lung cancer, XPA -4G>A (rs1800975) is also associated with the risk of NSCLC, especially for squamous cell carcinoma, among Asian young smokers.

Somatic cell hybridization analyses have previously shown that normal telomerase-negative fibroblasts and telomerase-positive immortalized cell lines contain repressors of ALT activity, indicating that activation of ALT results from loss of one or more unidentified repressors. More recently, ATRX or DAXX was shown to be mutated both in tumors with telomere lengths suggestive of ALT activity and in ALT cell lines. Here, an ALT cell line was separately fused to each of four telomerase-positive cell lines, and four or five independent hybrid lines from each fusion were examined for expression of ATRX and DAXX and for telomere lengthening mechanism. The hybrid lines expressed either telomerase or ALT, with the other mechanism being repressed. DAXX was expressed normally in all parental cell lines and in all of the hybrids. ATRX was expressed normally in each of the four telomerase-positive parental cell lines and in every telomerase-positive hybrid line, and was abnormal in the ALT parental cells and in all but one of the ALT hybrids. This correlation between ALT activity and loss of ATRX expression is consistent with ATRX being a repressor of ALT."}

There are several risk subgroups for which the available data are insufficient to recommend for or against screening, including women with a personal history of breast cancer, carcinoma in situ, atypical hyperplasia, and extremely dense breasts on mammography. Diagnostic uses of MRI were not considered to be within the scope of this review."}

We examined associations in APCAT of thirteen variants previously reported as genome-wide significant (P<5 x 10(-8)) and three variants reported as suggestive (P<5\u00d7 10(-7)). We also searched for novel associations in APCAT (Stage 1) and followed-up the most promising variants in 4,035 asthmatics and 11,251 healthy controls (Stage 2). Finally, we conducted the first genome-wide screen for interactions with smoking or hay fever.\nWe observed association in the same direction for all thirteen previously reported variants and nominally replicated ten of them. One variant that was previously suggestive, rs11071559 in RORA, now reaches genome-wide significance when combined with our data (P = 2.4 \u00d7 10(-9)). We also identified two genome-wide significant associations: rs13408661 near IL1RL1/IL18R1 (P(Stage1+Stage2) = 1.1x10(-9)), which is correlated with a variant recently shown to be associated with asthma (rs3771180), and rs9268516 in the HLA region (P(Stage1+Stage2) = 1.1x10(-8)), which appears to be independent of previously reported associations in this locus. Finally, we found no strong evidence for gene-environment interactions with smoking or hay fever status.\nPopulation-based cohorts with simple asthma phenotypes represent a valuable and largely untapped resource for genetic studies of asthma."}

One of the hurdles to clinical implementation is the high number of variants of unknown significance. For cancer-susceptibility genes, the difficulty in interpreting the clinical relevance of the genomic variants is compounded by the fact that most of what is known about these variants comes from the study of highly selected populations, such as cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. The genetic variation in known cancer-susceptibility genes in the general population has not been well characterized to date. To address this gap, we profiled the nonsynonymous genomic variation in 158 genes causally implicated in carcinogenesis using high-quality whole genome sequences from an ancestrally diverse cohort of 681 healthy individuals. We found that all individuals carry multiple variants that may impact cancer susceptibility, with an average of 68 variants per individual. Of the 2,688 allelic variants identified within the cohort, most are very rare, with 75% found in only 1 or 2 individuals in our population. Allele frequencies vary between ancestral groups, and there are 21 variants for which the minor allele in one population is the major allele in another. Detailed analysis of a selected subset of 5 clinically important cancer genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, KRAS, TP53, and PTEN, highlights differences between germline variants and reported somatic mutations. The dataset can serve a resource of genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in 6 ancestry groups, an important foundation for the interpretation of cancer risk from personal genome sequences."}

In genome-wide association (GWA) studies, these quantitative phenotypes may be relevant to disease development and serve as intermediate phenotypes or they could be behavioral or other risk factors that predict disease risk. Statistical tests combining both disease status and quantitative risk factors should be more powerful than case-control studies, as the former incorporates more information about the disease. In this paper, we proposed a modified inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis method to combine disease status and quantitative intermediate phenotype information. The simulation results showed that when an intermediate phenotype was available, the inverse-variance weighted method had more power than did a case-control study of complex diseases, especially in identifying susceptibility loci having minor effects. We further applied this modified meta-analysis to a study of imputed lung cancer genotypes with smoking data in 1154 cases and 1137 matched controls. The most significant SNPs came from the CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4 region on chromosome 15q24-25.1, which has been replicated in many other studies. Our results confirm that this CHRNA region is associated with both lung cancer development and smoking behavior. We also detected three significant SNPs--rs1800469, rs1982072, and rs2241714--in the promoter region of the TGFB1 gene on chromosome 19 (p\u200a=\u200a1.46\u00d710(-5), 1.18\u00d710(-5), and 6.57\u00d710(-6), respectively). The SNP rs1800469 is reported to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in cigarette smokers. The present study is the first GWA study to replicate this result. Signals in the 3q26 region were also identified in the meta-analysis. We demonstrate the intermediate phenotype can potentially enhance the power of complex disease association analysis and the modified meta-analysis method is robust to incorporate intermediate phenotype or other quantitative risk factor in the analysis."}

More importantly, a few single nucleotide polymorphisms seem to have a significant impact on the incidence of acute rejection or the adverse effects of immunosuppressants.

Typically, this problem is approached by testing each of the SNPs individually. This, however, can lead to an inaccurate measurement of the influence of the SNPs on the disease risk, in particular, if SNPs only show an effect when interacting with other SNPs, as the multivariate structure of the data is ignored. In this article, we propose a testing procedure based on logic regression that takes this structure into account and therefore enables a more appropriate quantification of importance and ranking of the SNPs than marginal testing. Since even SNP interactions often exhibit only a moderate effect on the disease risk, it can be helpful to also consider sets of SNPs (e.g. SNPs belonging to the same gene or pathway) to borrow strength across these SNP sets and to identify those genes or pathways comprising SNPs that are most consistently associated with the response. We show how the proposed procedure can be adapted for testing SNP sets, and how it can be applied to blocks of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) to overcome problems caused by LD."}

This SNP is within a 537\u00a0kb intergenic region, bordered by CDCA7 and SP3.

Associations with ADEH were stronger with the combined null mutations (OR, 10.1; 4.7-22.1; P = 1.99 x 10(-11)). Associations with the R501X mutation were replicated in the African American population; the null mutation was absent among healthy African American subjects, but present among patients with AD (3.2%; P = .035) and common among patients with ADEH (9.4%; P = .0049). However, the 2282del4 mutation was absent among African American patients with ADEH and rare (<1%) among healthy individuals.\nThe R501X mutation in the gene encoding filaggrin, one of the strongest genetic predictors of AD, confers an even greater risk for ADEH in both European and African ancestry populations, suggesting a role for defective skin barrier in this devastating condition."}

Candidate gene approach have identified association of genetic variants in the Wnt signaling pathway genes and increased susceptibility to several diseases including breast cancer. Due to the rarity of somatic mutations in key genes of Wnt pathway, we investigated the association of genetic variants in these genes with predisposition to breast cancers. We performed a case-control study to identify risk variants by examining 15 SNPs located in 8 genes associated with Wnt signaling. Genotypic analysis of individual locus showed statistically significant association of five SNPs located in \u03b2-catenin, AXIN2, DKK3, SFRP3 and TCF7L2 with breast cancers. Increased risk was observed only with the SNP in \u03b2-catenin while the other four SNPs conferred protection against breast cancers. Majority of these associations persisted after stratification of the cases based on estrogen receptor status and age of on-set of breast cancer. The rs7775 SNP in exon 6 of SFRP3 gene that codes for either arginine or glycine exhibited very strong association with breast cancer, even after Bonferroni's correction. Apart from these five variants, rs3923086 in AXIN2 and rs3763511 in DKK4 that did not show any association in the overall population were significantly associated with early on-set and estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, respectively. This is the first study to utilize pathway based approach to identify association of risk variants in the Wnt signaling pathway genes with breast cancers. Confirmation of our findings in larger populations of different ethnicities would provide evidence for the role of Wnt pathway as well as screening markers for early detection of breast carcinomas."}

In both studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg every 12 hours) in combination with ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 hours) or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 24.\nA total of 1108 patients underwent randomization and received study drug. The mean baseline FEV1 was 61% of the predicted value. In both studies, there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor-ivacaftor dose groups; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points (P<0.001), which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of 4.3 to 6.7% (P<0.001). Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39% lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups as well. The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups. The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was 4.2% among patients who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor versus 1.6% among those who received placebo.\nThese data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation.

Genetic variants within the 5' splice site can cause splicing differences among human individuals and constitute an important class of human disease mutations. In this study, we explored whether natural variations of splicing could reveal important signals of 5' splice site recognition. In seven lymphoblastoid cell lines of Asian, European and African ancestry, we identified 1174 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the consensus 5' splice site. We selected 129 SNPs predicted to significantly alter the splice site activity, and quantitatively examined their splicing impact in the seven individuals. Surprisingly, outside of the essential GT dinucleotide position, only \u223c14% of the tested SNPs altered splicing. Bioinformatic and minigene analyses identified signals that could modify the impact of 5' splice site polymorphisms, most notably a strong 3' splice site and the presence of intronic motifs downstream of the 5' splice site. Strikingly, we found that the poly-G run, a known intronic splicing enhancer, was the most significantly enriched motif downstream of exons unaffected by 5' splice site SNPs. In TRIM62, the upstream 3' splice site and downstream intronic poly-G runs functioned redundantly to protect an exon from its 5' splice site polymorphism. Collectively, our study reveals widespread context-dependent robustness to 5' splice site polymorphisms in human transcriptomes. Consequently, certain exons are more susceptible to 5' splice site mutations. Additionally, our work demonstrates that genetic diversity of alternative splicing can provide significant insights into the splicing code of mammalian cells."}

We analyzed 16 polymorphisms in 8 genes involved in DNA repair, apoptotic and inflammatory pathways to find out combinations of genetic variants contributing to GBC risk. The genes included in the study were XRCC1, OGG1, ERCC2, MSH2, CASP8, TLR2, TLR4 and PTGS2. Single locus analysis by logistic regression showed association of MSH2 IVS1+9G>C (rs2303426), ERCC2 Asp312Asn (rs1799793), OGG1 Ser326Cys (rs1052133), OGG1 IVS4-15C>G (rs2072668), CASP8 -652 6N ins/del (rs3834129), PTGS2 -1195G>A (rs689466), PTGS2 -765G>C (rs20417), TLR4 Ex4+936C>T (rs4986791) and TLR2 -196 to -174del polymorphisms with GBC risk. The CART analysis revealed OGG1 Ser326Cys, and OGG1 IVS4-15C>G polymorphisms as the best polymorphic signature for discriminating between cases and controls. In the GoM analysis, the data was categorized into six sets representing risk for GBC with respect to the investigated polymorphisms. Sets I, II and III described low intrinsic risk (controls) characterized by multiple protective alleles while sets IV, V and VI represented high intrinsic risk groups (GBC cases) characterized by the presence of multiple risk alleles. The CART and GoM analyses also showed the importance of PTGS2 -1195G>A polymorphism in susceptibility to GBC risk.

A common functional polymorphism in the SCN1A gene (one of the genes encoding the drug target) has been previously associated with maximum dose of phenytoin used clinically, and also maximum dose of carbamazepine, another antiepileptic drug with the same drug target.\nWe have related variation at the SCN1A IVS5-91 G>A polymorphism to maximum dose and to maintenance dose of phenytoin in 168 patients with epilepsy treated with phenytoin. We also related genotype to phenytoin serum levels at maximum dose and at maintenance dose of phenytoin. We genotyped the polymorphism using an Applied Biosystems Taqman assay.\nThe polymorphism is associated with phenytoin serum concentration at maintenance dose (P=0.03). In a reduced cohort of 71 patients receiving phenytoin monotherapy this association is also significant (P=0.03). Neither association remains significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.\nThese results are not a replication of the original study. They do, however, support the hypothesis that this polymorphism influences the clinical use of phenytoin. They also demonstrate the utility of using multiple phenotypes in pharmacogenetics studies, particularly when attempting to separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. As the SCN1A polymorphism affects phenytoin pharmacodynamics, it is particularly useful to obtain data on serum levels in addition to dose because association of a pharmacodynamic variant may be stronger with serum levels than dose as the serum level may eliminate or reduce pharmacokinetic variability."}

Overall, the variant allele of Asp312Asn polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer (Asn/Asn vs. Asp/Asp: OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.19-1.91; Asp/Asn vs. Asp/Asp: OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.35; recessive model: OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.10-1.61; dominant model: OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.14-1.52; and allele comparing: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11-1.42). We found the Lys751Gln was associated with increased bladder cancer risk only under the recessive model (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.29). Stratification analyses demonstrated an increased risk for Asians and hospital-based studies under all genetic models while only under the dominant model for Caucasians as to the Asp312Asn polymorphism and for Caucasians under the recessive model as to the Lys751Gln polymorphism. We also found the Asp312Asn polymorphism can significantly influence mRNA expression levels among Asians and Caucasians, and the Lys751Gln polymorphism has a similar effect for Caucasians. Despite some limitations, this meta-analysis suggests that polymorphisms in XPD gene may contribute to bladder cancer susceptibility. These findings need further validation by large well-designed prospective studies."}

The aim of the present study was to extend these observations by examining gene-environment interactions between several common polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes XRCC1 and ERCC2/XPD and vinyl chloride exposure on the production of vinyl chloride-induced biomarkers of mutation. A cohort of 546 French vinyl chloride workers were genotyped for the XRCC1 codon 194 (Arg>Trp; rs1799782), 280 (Arg>His; rs25489) and 399 (Arg>Gln; rs25487) polymorphisms and the ERCC2/XPD codon 312 (Asp>Asn; rs1799793) and 751 (Lys>Gln; rs13181) polymorphisms. The results demonstrated a statistically significant allele dosage effect of the XRCC1 399 variant on the production of the vinyl chloride-induced mutant p53 biomarker, even after controlling for confounders including cumulative vinyl chloride exposure (p = 0.03), with a potentially supramultiplicative gene-environment interaction.

Recently, novel genome partitioning methods have been developed that allow to target re-sequencing to specific genomic compartments, but practical experience with these methods is still limited. In this study, we have combined a novel droplet-based multiplex PCR method and next generation sequencing to screen patients with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) for mutations in 86 previously identified XLMR genes. In total, affected males from 24 large XLMR families were analyzed, including three in whom the mutations were already known. Amplicons corresponding to functionally relevant regions of these genes were sequenced on an Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer II platform. Highly specific and uniform enrichment was achieved: on average, 67.9% unambiguously mapped reads were derived from amplicons, and for 88.5% of the targeted bases, the sequencing depth was sufficient to reliably detect variations. Potentially disease-causing sequence variants were identified in 10 out of 24 patients, including the three mutations that were already known, and all of these could be confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The robust performance of this approach demonstrates the general utility of droplet-based multiplex PCR for parallel mutation screening in hundreds of genes, which is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of mental retardation and other disorders that may be due to defects of a wide variety of genes.\nThe online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s11568-010-9137-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."}

We examined 161 osteoporotic women (at least one low energy spinal fracture) and 131 normal women. We investigated sequence variations in the TGF-beta 1 gene using the single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique combined with DNA sequencing. Seven patients were heterozygous for a cytosine to thymidine base substitution at position 76 in exon 5 (C788-T) (corresponding to position 788 in the TGF-beta 1 cDNA), resulting in a threonine to isoleucine amino acid shift at position 263 in the TGF-beta 1 propeptide (Thr263-Ile). Ten other patients had a one base deletion in the intron sequence 8 bases prior to exon 5 (713-8delC), which could influence splicing. Five normal women exhibited the C788-T sequence variant, and two the 713-8delC. The prevalence of 713-8delC was significantly higher in the osteoporotic group (chi 2 = 4.02, p < 0.05). Osteoporotic patients with the 713-8delC variant had increased levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05). If the osteoporotic patients with a z score of the lumbar spine below -1 were examined separately, we found increased serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05), increased urinary excretion of hydroxyproline (p < 0.05), and reduced bone mass of the lumbar spine (p < 0.05) in patients with 713-8delC. No correlation to bone mass was demonstrated in the normal women, but 713-8delC was associated with increased serum levels of bone alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05). The sequence variation, 713-8delC, in the TGF-beta 1 gene is more frequent in patients with osteoporosis compared to normal controls. The 713-8delC variant seems to be associated with very low bone mass in osteoporotic women with low bone mass and increased bone turnover in both osteoporotic and normal women."}

RT-PCR was performed to determine whether these variants disrupted correct splicing. To ensure efficient detection of transcripts containing premature termination codons, a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay inhibitor was added to the lymphoblastoid cell lines of the patients before RNA extraction. We found that BRCA1 IVS3+3A>C, 4304G>A (in the last codon of exon 12), and IVS19+2delT and BRCA2 IVS6+1G>A, IVS23-2A>G, and IVS24+1G>A lead to aberrant transcripts in lymphocytes. Therefore, they were considered to be true pathogenic mutations, predisposing carriers to cancers of the hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome. BRCA2 IVS24-16T>C is a frequent polymorphism in linkage disequilibrium, with a polymorphic stop codon in exon 27, K3326X. BRCA1 IVS2-14C>T and BRCA2 IVS9-5insT and IVS25+9A>C represent rare variants, not disrupting normal splicing in blood lymphocytes. However, some of the alterations may act differently, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, in breast or ovarian tissues. The data provided in this paper allowed more accurate risk estimation of patients and relatives carrying the mutations described herein and have facilitated genetic counseling. Furthermore, our study is important for a better understanding of splicing mechanisms and revealed new patterns of alternative splicing in BRCA1 and BRCA2."}

Mutations in ALOXE3 and ALOX12B on chromosome 17p13, which code for two different epidermal lipoxygenases, were recently found in patients with ichthyosiform erythroderma from Turkey, France, and North Africa. Here we describe molecular and clinical findings in 17 families with ARCI originating from Central Europe, Turkey, and the Indian subcontinent, with mutations in ALOXE3 or ALOX12B. We identified 11 novel point mutations in ALOX12B (one nonsense mutation and 10 missense mutations) and four different inactivating mutations in ALOXE3. The gene products of ALOX12B and ALOXE3, the epidermal lipoxygenases 12R-LOX and eLOX3, respectively, are preferentially synthesized in the skin. They act in sequence to convert arachidonic acid via 12(R)-HPETE to the corresponding epoxyalcohol, 8(R)-hydroxy-11(R),12(R)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid. To assess the impairment of enzyme activity, we expressed the mutated genes in vitro and determined the activity of the recombinant proteins toward their genuine substrates.

The recommendations are intended to provide information about the process of genetic counseling and risk assessment for hereditary cancer disorders rather than specific information about individual syndromes. Key components include the intake (medical and family histories), psychosocial assessment (assessment of risk perception), cancer risk assessment (determination and communication of risk), molecular testing for hereditary cancer syndromes (regulations, informed consent, and counseling process), and follow-up considerations. These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome.

Genome-wide association studies of prostate cancer have yielded several variants that have significantly replicated across studies, predominantly in cases unselected for family history of prostate cancer.

Such variants hold great potential value for risk stratification, particularly for early-onset or aggressive prostate cancer, given the comorbidities associated with current therapies. Here, we investigate a Caucasian study population of 523 independent familial prostate cancer cases and 523 age-matched controls without a personal or family history of prostate cancer. We replicate identified associations at genome-wide association study loci 8q24, 11q13, and 2p15 (P = 2.9 x 10(-4) to P = 4.7 x 10(-5)), showing study population power. We also find evidence to support reported associations at candidate genes RNASEL, EZH2, and NKX3-1 (P = 0.031 to P = 0.0085). We further explore a set of candidate genes related to RNASEL and to its role in retroviral restriction, identifying nominal associations at XPR1 and RBM9. The effects at 8q24 seem more pronounced for those diagnosed at an early age, whereas at 2p15 and RNASEL the effects were more pronounced at a later age. However, these trends did not reach statistical significance. The effects at 2p15 were statistically significantly more pronounced for those diagnosed with aggressive disease."}

After accounting for the effects of population stratification, effects of covariates and genotype x sex interactions on the GWAA of RA were assessed by conducting association and interaction analyses. We found significant allelic associations, covariate, and genotype x sex interaction effects on RA. Several top single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (~22 SNPs) showed significant associations with strong p-values (p < 1 x 10-4 - p < 1 x 10-24). Only three SNPs on chromosomes 4, 13, and 20 were significant after Bonferroni correction, and none of these three SNPs showed significant genotype x sex interactions. Of the 30 top SNPs with significant (p < 1 x 10-4 - p < 1 x 10-6) interactions, ~23 SNPs showed additive interactions and ~5 SNPs showed only dominance interactions. Those SNPs showing significant associations in the regular logistic regression failed to show significant interactions. In contrast, the SNPs that showed significant interactions failed to show significant associations in models that did not incorporate interactions. It is important to consider interactions of genotype x sex in addition to associations in a GWAA of RA. Furthermore, the association between SNPs and RA susceptibility varies significantly between men and women."}

Using Illumina genotyping followed by imputation, we generated 268 034 consensus genotypes and in excess of 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for analysis. Association signals were assessed for replication in a second panel of 2286 European cases and 3160 European controls. Four loci achieved genome-wide significance for AD and replicated consistently across all cohorts. These included the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1, the genomic region proximal to LRRC32 on chromosome 11, the RAD50/IL13 locus on chromosome 5 and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6; reflecting action of classical HLA alleles. We observed variation in the contribution towards co-morbid asthma for these regions of association. We further explored the genetic relationship between AD, asthma and psoriasis by examining previously identified susceptibility SNPs for these diseases. We found considerable overlap between AD and psoriasis together with variable coincidence between allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of AD incorporates immune and epidermal barrier defects with combinations of specific and overlapping effects at individual loci."}

Recent attempts to identify the gene responsible for the linkage have produced inconsistent evidence for association of DD with a number of genes in a 575-kb region of chromosome 6p22.2, including VMP, DCDC2, KIAA0319, TTRAP, and THEM2. We aimed to identify the specific gene or genes involved by performing a systematic, high-density (approximately 2-3-kb intervals) linkage disequilibrium screen of these genes in an independent sample, incorporating family-based and case-control designs in which dyslexia was defined as an extreme representation of reading disability. Using DNA pooling, we first observed evidence for association with 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 13 of which were located in the KIAA0319 gene (P<.01-.003). After redundant SNPs were excluded, 10 SNPs were individually genotyped in 223 subjects with DD and 273 controls. Those SNPs that were significant at P</=.05 were next genotyped in a semi-independent sample of 143 trios of probands with DD and their parents, to control for possible population stratification. Six SNPs showed significant evidence of association in both samples (P</=.04-.002), including a SNP (rs4504469) in exon 4 of the KIAA0319 gene that changes an amino acid (P=.002; odds ratio 1.5). Logistic regression analysis showed that two SNPs (rs4504469 and rs6935076) in the KIAA0319 gene best explained DD status. The haplotype composed of these two markers was significantly associated with DD (global P=.00001 in the case-control sample; P=.02 in trios). This finding was largely driven by underrepresentation of the most common haplotype in cases (P=.00003 in the case-control sample; P=.006 in trios; 1-degree-of-freedom tests). Our data strongly implicate KIAA0319 as a susceptibility gene for dyslexia. The gene product is expressed in brain, but its specific function is currently unknown."}

DNA samples were tested for mutations by sequencing only or by a combination of single-stranded conformational analysis and by sequencing. Production of fluorescent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) was used to measure enzymatic activity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins. The affinity and the specificity of mutant IMPDH1 proteins for single-stranded nucleic acids were determined by filter-binding assays.\nFive different IMPDH1 variants, Thr116Met, Asp226Asn, Val268Ile, Gly324Asp, and His 372Pro, were identified in eight autosomal dominant RP families. Two additional IMPDH1 variants, Arg105Trp and Asn198Lys, were found in two patients with isolated LCA. None of the novel IMPDH1 mutants identified in this study altered the enzymatic activity of the corresponding proteins. In contrast, the affinity and/or the specificity of single-stranded nucleic acid binding were altered for each IMPDH1 mutant except the Gly324Asp variant.\nMutations in IMPDH1 account for approximately 2% of families with adRP, and de novo IMPDH1 mutations are also rare causes of isolated LCA. This analysis of the novel IMPDH1 mutants substantiates previous reports that IMPDH1 mutations do not alter enzyme activity and demonstrates that these mutants alter the recently identified single-stranded nucleic acid binding property of IMPDH. Studies are needed to further characterize the functional significance of IMPDH1 nucleic acid binding and its potential relationship to retinal degeneration."}

Gene expression was determined for all four SPINK genes by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated (n=15) and diet-treated patients (n=31) and controls (n=16). Genetic association of the four SPINK genes was tested within a total of 18 haplotype tagging SNPs, one coding SNP, 310 patients, and 180 controls. The SPINK4 study cohort was further expanded to include 479 CD cases and 540 controls. SPINK4 DNA sequence analysis was performed on six members of a multigeneration CD family to detect possible point mutations or deletions. SPINK4 showed differential gene expression, which was at its highest in untreated patients and dropped sharply upon commencement of a gluten-free diet. Genetic association tests for all four SPINK genes were negative, including SPINK4 in the extended case/control cohort. No SPINK4 mutations or deletions were observed in the multigeneration CD family with linkage to chromosome 9p21-13 nor was the coding SNP disease-specific.

We assessed the effects of the rs3812718 genotype on cortical excitability at baseline and after administration of carbamazepine in order to investigate the mechanism of this association.\nPaired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied in 92 healthy volunteers with the homozygous genotypes AA or GG of rs3812718 at baseline and after application of 400\u00a0mg of carbamazepine or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. Resting motor threshold (RMT), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and cortical silent period (CSP) were determined.\nAt baseline there was no significant difference in any TMS parameter. Genotype GG was associated with a higher carbamazepine-induced increase in CSP duration as compared to AA (multivariate analysis of covariance [MANCOVA], p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). An expected significant increase in RMT was genotype independent.\nWe found that the rs3812718 genotype modifies the effect of carbamazepine on CSP duration (mainly reflecting modulation of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition), but not on RMT (mainly reflecting modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels). This provides evidence that rs3812718 affects the pharmacoresponse to carbamazepine via an effect on GABAergic cortical interneurons. Our results also confirm that TMS is useful to investigate the effect of genetic variants on cortical excitability and pharmacoresponse."}

BBS has been modeled historically as an autosomal recessive trait, under which premise six independent BBS loci (BBS1-BBS6) have been mapped in the human genome. However, extended mutational analyses of BBS2 and BBS6, the first two BBS genes cloned, suggest that BBS exhibits a more complex pattern of inheritance, in which three mutations at two loci simultaneously are necessary and sufficient in some families to manifest the phenotype. We evaluated the spectrum of mutations in the recently identified BBS4 gene with a combination of haplotype analysis and mutation screening on a multiethnic cohort of 177 families. Consistent with predictions from previous genetic analyses, our data suggest that mutations in BBS4 contribute to BBS in <3% of affected families. Furthermore, integrated mutational data from all three currently cloned BBS genes raise the possibility that BBS4 may participate in triallelic inheritance with BBS2 and BBS1, but not the other known loci. Establishment of the loci pairing in triallelism is likely to be important for the elucidation of the functional relationships among the different BBS proteins."}

All amplicon lengths were shorter than 160 base pairs. The DIPplex genotype distributions showed no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg rule expectations (Bonferroni corrected) except for DLH39 in the Taiwanese population. Among the Poles and the Taiwanese the mean observed heterozygosity values are 0.4385 and 0.4079, and the combined matching probability values are 7.98 \u00d7 10(-14) and 1.22 \u00d7 10(-11), respectively. The investigated marker set has been confirmed as a potential extension to standard short tandem repeat-based kits or a separate informative system for individual identification and kinship analysis. Eight INDELs have been selected as possible ancestry informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms for further analyses."}

Our aim was to examine the association between myopia and the polymorphisms within TGF-beta2, bFGF, and FMOD.\nThe study group comprised of patients (n=195; age range: 17-24 years) with a spherical equivalent of -6.5 diopters (D) or a more negative refractive error. The control group comprised of individuals (n=94; age range: 17-25 years) with a spherical equivalent ranging from -0.5 D to +1.0 D. The subjects with astigmatism over -0.75 D were excluded from the study. High resolution melting (HRM) genotyping and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping were used to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The polymorphisms detected were TGF-beta2 (rs7550232 and rs991967), bFGF (rs308395 and rs41348645), and FMOD (rs7543418). Moreover, a stepwise logistic regression procedure was used to detect which of the significant SNPs contributed to the main effects of myopia development.\nThere were significant differences in the frequency of the A allele and A/A genotype in TGF-beta2 (rs7550232; p=0.0178 and 0.03, respectively). Moreover, the haplotype distribution of haplotype 2 (Ht2; A/A) of TGF-beta2 differed significantly between the two groups (p=0.014). The results of the stepwise logistic regression procedure revealed that TGF-beta2 (rs7550232) contributed significantly to the development of high myopia.\nTGF-beta2 is an important structure of sclera and might contribute to the formation of myopia. TGF-beta2 (rs7550232) polymorphisms, A allele and A/A genotype, had a protective role against the development of high myopia."}

A pharmacogenetic association has been reported whereby increased expression of exon 5N containing Na(V) 1.1 transcripts correlated with lower required doses of phenytoin in epileptics. We tested the hypothesis that SCN1A alternative splicing affects the pharmacology of Na(V) 1.1 channels.\nTo directly examine biophysical and pharmacologic differences between the exon 5 splice variants, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recording of tsA201 cells transiently coexpressing either Na(V) 1.1-5A or Na(V) 1.1-5N with the \u03b21 and \u03b22 accessory subunits. We examined tonic inhibition and use-dependent inhibition of Na(V) 1.1 splice isoforms by phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. We also examined the effects of phenytoin and lamotrigine on channel biophysical properties and determined concentration-response relationships for both splice variants.\nWe observed no significant differences in voltage dependence of activation, steady-state inactivation, and recovery from inactivation between splice variants. However, Na(V) 1.1-5N channels exhibited enhanced tonic block by phenytoin and lamotrigine compared to Na(V) 1.1-5A. In addition, Na(V) 1.1-5N exhibited enhanced use-dependent block by phenytoin and lamotrigine across a range of stimulation frequencies and concentrations. Phenytoin and lamotrigine induced shifts in steady-state inactivation and recovery from fast inactivation for both splice isoforms. No splice isoform differences were observed for channel inhibition by carbamazepine.\nThese results suggest Na(V) 1.1 channels containing exon 5N are more sensitive to the commonly used antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and lamotrigine."}

Understanding how the millions of SNPs in the human genome are involved in conferring susceptibility or resistance to disease, or in rendering a drug efficacious or toxic in the individual is a major goal of the relatively new fields of pharmacogenomics. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a high-mortality cancer with complex etiology and progression involving both genetic and environmental factors. We examined the association between esophageal cancer risk and patterns of 61 SNPs in a case-control study for a population from Shanxi Province in North Central China that has among the highest rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the world.\nHigh-throughput Masscode mass spectrometry genotyping was done on genomic DNA from 574 individuals (394 cases and 180 age-frequency matched controls). SNPs were chosen from among genes involving DNA repair enzymes, and Phase I and Phase II enzymes. We developed a novel adaptation of the Decision Forest pattern recognition method named Decision Forest for SNPs (DF-SNPs). The method was designated to analyze the SNP data.\nThe classifier in separating the cases from the controls developed with DF-SNPs gave concordance, sensitivity and specificity, of 94.7%, 99.0% and 85.1%, respectively; suggesting its usefulness for hypothesizing what SNPs or combinations of SNPs could be involved in susceptibility to esophageal cancer. Importantly, the DF-SNPs algorithm incorporated a randomization test for assessing the relevance (or importance) of individual SNPs, SNP types (Homozygous common, heterozygous and homozygous variant) and patterns of SNP types (SNP patterns) that differentiate cases from controls. For example, we found that the different genotypes of SNP GADD45B E1122 are all associated with cancer risk.\nThe DF-SNPs method can be used to differentiate esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases from controls based on individual SNPs, SNP types and SNP patterns. The method could be useful to identify potential biomarkers from the SNP data and complement existing methods for genotype analyses."}

We have examined monoaminergic candidate genes for possible genetic association with ADHD in the Irish population, focusing particularly on genes of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We have observed that several of these genes are associated with ADHD, including DAT1, DBH, DRD4, DRD5, and 5HT1B. Here, we present what appears to be a systematic overtransmission of paternal alleles at candidate genes associated with ADHD. For the nine genes included in the analysis, the overall odds ratio for paternal transmission was 2, compared with 1.3 for maternal transmission (paternal vs. maternal chi 2=9.6; P=.0019). Transmission to females, from either parent, was significantly stronger than to males. Possible reasons for this preferential transmission include imprinting and ascertainment bias, although results of further analyses show that the latter is unlikely."}

To analyse the possible contribution of the ERCC2/XPD functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in genetic susceptibility to SLE, the rs13181 and rs1799793 SNPs in ERCC2/XPD were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Association was studied by case-control analyses using samples from 172 SLE patients and 160 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was performed to detect the association with genetic predisposition to SLE and the clinical features. Although these two functional genetic variations are linked to several immune dysfunction-induced diseases, no statistically significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies were observed between SLE patients and controls. Haplotype analysis showed that none of ERCC2/XPD haplotypes was associated with the incidence of SLE disease, nor the preference of clinical features. In conclusion, the ERCC2/XPD functional polymorphisms analysed in this study showed no association in genetic susceptibility to SLE."}

The molecular study included analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments of SCN1A and SCN1B exons by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing of GABRG2 in all families. We excluded SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 genes with linkage analysis in a large pedigree and directly sequenced SCN2A in a family with neonatal-infantile seizures onset. We compared the epilepsy phenotypes observed in our families with those of GEFS+ families harboring mutations of SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 and estimated the percentage of mutations of these genes among GEFS+ cases by reviewing all published studies.\nInheritance was autosomal dominant with 69% penetrance. Forty-one individuals had epilepsy: 29 had a phenotype consistent with GEFS+; seven had idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE); in three, the epilepsy type could not be classified; and two were considered phenocopies. Clinical phenotypes included FS+ (29.2%), FS (29.2%), IGE (18.2%), FS+ with focal seizures (13%) or absence seizures (2.6%), and FS with absence seizures (2.6%). Molecular study of SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 did not reveal any mutation. Results of our study and literature review indicate that mutations of SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 in patients with GEFS+ are rare.\nThe most frequently observed phenotypes matched those reported in families with mutations of the SCN1A, SCN1B, and GABRG2 genes. IGE and GEFS+ may overlap in some families, suggesting a shared genetic mechanism. The observation that 13% of affected individuals had focal epilepsy confirms previously reported rates and should prompt a reformulation of the \"GEFS+\" concept to include focal epileptogenesis."}

Each practice guideline focuses on a clinical or practice-based issue and is the result of a review and analysis of current professional literature believed to be reliable. As such, information and recommendations within the ACMG and NSGC joint practice guidelines reflect the current scientific and clinical knowledge at the time of publication, are current only as of their publication date, and are subject to change without notice as advances emerge. In addition, variations in practice, which take into account the needs of the individual patient and the resources and limitations unique to the institution or type of practice, may warrant approaches, treatments, and/or procedures that differ from the recommendations outlined in this guideline. Therefore, these recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. Genetic counseling practice guidelines are never intended to displace a health-care provider's best medical judgment based on the clinical circumstances of a particular patient or patient population. Practice guidelines are published by the ACMG or the NSGC for educational and informational purposes only, and neither the ACMG nor the NSGC \"approve\" or \"endorse\" any specific methods, practices, or sources of information.Cancer genetic consultation is an important aspect of the care of individuals at increased risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Yet several patient, clinician, and system-level barriers hinder identification of individuals appropriate for cancer genetics referral. Thus, the purpose of this practice guideline is to present a single set of comprehensive personal and family history criteria to facilitate identification and maximize appropriate referral of at-risk individuals for cancer genetic consultation. To develop this guideline, a literature search for hereditary cancer susceptibility syndromes was conducted using PubMed. In addition, GeneReviews and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were reviewed when applicable. When conflicting guidelines were identified, the evidence was ranked as follows: position papers from national and professional organizations ranked highest, followed by consortium guidelines, and then peer-reviewed publications from single institutions. The criteria for cancer genetic consultation referral are provided in two formats: (i) tables that list the tumor type along with the criteria that, if met, would warrant a referral for a cancer genetic consultation and (ii) an alphabetical list of the syndromes, including a brief summary of each and the rationale for the referral criteria that were selected. Consider referral for a cancer genetic consultation if your patient or any of their first-degree relatives meet any of these referral criteria."}

Our primary hypothesis was that the TP53 mutation spectrum is influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. We observed a TP53 mutation frequency in exons 5-8 of 25%. Functional polymorphisms in XPD (Asp312Asn, rs1799793 and Lys751Gln, rs1052559), a protein required for nucleotide excision repair and with roles in p53-mediated apoptosis, were modestly associated with G:C-->T:A mutations in TP53 in lung tumors [Asp/Asn312 + Asn/Asn312 and/or Lys/Gln751 + Gln/Gln751 versus Asp/Asp312 + Lys/Lys751; odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-7.61], consistent with the role of this protein in repair of bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts.

A single SNP analysis showed a significantly increased risk given by XRCC1-rs915927 G allele (OR=1.55, CI 95% 1.02-2.37 for dominant model) and a protective effect of the rare alleles of 3 ERCC1 SNPs: rs967591 (OR=0.66, CI 95% 0.46-0.95), rs735482 (OR=0.62, CI 95% 0.42-0.90) and rs2336219 (OR=0.63, CI 95% 0.43-0.93). Haplotype analysis revealed that cases had a statistically significant excess of XRCC3-TAGT and ERCC1-GAT haplotypes, whereas ERCC1-AAC, MGMT-TA, XRCC1-TGCC and ERCC2-TGAA haplotypes were significantly underrepresented. Together with other published data on large case-control studies, our findings provide epidemiological evidence supporting a link between DNA repair gene variants and bladder cancer development, and suggest that the effects of high-order interactions should be taken into account as modulating factors affecting bladder cancer risk. A detailed characterization of DNA repair genetic variation is warranted and might ultimately help to identify multiple susceptibility variants that could be responsible for joint effects on the risk."}

However, the role of germline genetic variants in this complex in relation to cancer risk is not well studied.\nWe assessed the association of 16 variants in the catalytic subunits (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4) of the SWI/SNF complex with the risk of glioma subtypes (lower grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma [GBM]) and with mortality from high-grade tumors (GBM) in a multicenter US case-control study that included 561 cases and 574 controls. Associations were estimated with odds ratios (OR, for risk) or hazards ratios (HR, for mortality) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). False discovery rate (FDR-q) was used to control for multiple testing in risk associations.\nNone of the investigated SNPs was associated with overall glioma risk. However, analyses according to histological subtypes revealed a statistically significant increased risk of oligodendroglioma in association with SMARCA2 rs2296212 (OR = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.11-14.80, P = 0.030, q = 0.08) and rs4741651 (OR = 4.68, 95% CI = 1.43-15.30, P = 0.011, q = 0.08) and SMARCA4 rs11672232 (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.01-3.58, P = 0.048, q = 0.08) and rs12232780 (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.06-4.33, P = 0.035, q = 0.08). No significant risk associations were observed for GBM or lower grade astrocytoma. Suggestive associations with GBM mortality were not validated in the Cancer Genome Atlas.\nOur findings suggest that genetic variants in SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 influence the risk of oligodendroglioma.

This study tests a series of allelic variants within such candidate genes to determine their potential influence on ADHD susceptibility.\nWe used a population sample ascertained from a birth cohort of a subpopulation of Finland, characterized by founder effect and isolation, thus minimizing genetic heterogeneity. The subjects were systematically ascertained using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 of more than 9,000 individuals, resulting in the study sample of 188 ADHD cases and 166 controls. We genotyped markers in 13 candidate genes, including critical components of dopamine and serotonin pathways.\nWe report evidence for association of ADHD with allelic variants of the dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes.\nOur study supports the involvement of the dopamine pathway in the etiology of ADHD; specifically the genes DBH and DRD2 deserve more attention in further studies."}

To test the hypothesis that other similar elastin mutations may predispose to COPD, we screened 90 probands from the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study and 90 smoking control subjects from the Normative Aging Study for mutations in elastin exons using high-resolution DNA melt analysis followed by resequencing. Rare nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) seen only in cases were examined for segregation with airflow obstruction within pedigrees. Common nonsynonymous SNPs were tested for association with COPD in a family-based analysis of 949 subjects from the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study, and in a case-control analysis in 389 COPD cases from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial and 472 control subjects from the Normative Aging Study. Of 28 elastin variants found, 3 were nonsynonymous SNPs found only in cases. The previously described Gly773Asp mutation was found in another proband. The other two SNPs did not clearly segregate with COPD within families. Two common nonsynonymous SNPs did not demonstrate significant associations in either a family-based or case-control analysis.

A major challenge for candidate gene association studies in asthma is the selection of biologically relevant genes.\nUsing epithelial RNA expression arrays, HapMap allele frequency variation, and the literature, we identified six possible candidate susceptibility genes for childhood asthma including ADCY2, DNAH5, KIF3A, PDE4B, PLAU, SPRR2B. To evaluate these genes, we compared the genotypes of 194 predominantly tagging SNPs in 790 asthmatic, allergic and non-allergic children. We found that SNPs in all six genes were nominally associated with asthma (p<0.05) in our discovery cohort and in three independent cohorts at either the SNP or gene level (p<0.05). Further, we determined that our selection approach was superior to random selection of genes either differentially expressed in asthmatics compared to controls (p\u200a=\u200a0.0049) or selected based on the literature alone (p\u200a=\u200a0.0049), substantiating the validity of our gene selection approach. Importantly, we observed that 7 of 9 SNPs in the KIF3A gene more than doubled the odds of asthma (OR\u200a=\u200a2.3, p<0.0001) and increased the odds of allergic disease (OR\u200a=\u200a1.8, p<0.008). Our data indicate that KIF3A rs7737031 (T-allele) has an asthma population attributable risk of 18.5%. The association between KIF3A rs7737031 and asthma was validated in 3 independent populations, further substantiating the validity of our gene selection approach.\nOur study demonstrates that KIF3A, a member of the kinesin superfamily of microtubule associated motors that are important in the transport of protein complexes within cilia, is a novel candidate gene for childhood asthma. Polymorphisms in KIF3A may in part be responsible for poor mucus and/or allergen clearance from the airways.

We have studied the role of two nucleotide substitutions in the XPD gene, one in exon 23 leading to an amino acid substitution (Lys751Gln) and one silent in exon 6 in relation to basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Both are two-allele polymorphisms, with the nucleobases A and C at the given positions. We genotyped psoriasis patients with and without BCC and nonpsoriatic persons with and without BCC (4 x 20 persons). The choice to study psoriasis patients was motivated by their high genotoxic exposure via treatment and their high relative rate of early BCC. Subjects carrying two A alleles (AA genotype) in exon 23 were at 4.3-fold higher risk of BCC than subjects with two C alleles (95% CI, 0.79-23.57). In addition, the mean age at first skin tumor for BCC cases with the AA genotype was significantly lower than the mean age for BCC cases with the AC or CC genotype (P = 0.012). Thus, the variant C-allele of exon 23 may be protective. The exon 6 genotype was associated with the risk of BCC among the psoriasis patients; psoriatics carrying two A alleles in exon 6 were at 5.3-fold higher risk of BCC than psoriatics with two C alleles (95% CI, 0.78-36.31). For the psoriatics, the mean age at onset of BCC for cases with the AA genotype was marginally lower than the mean age for cases with genotype AC or CC (P = 0.060). Our results raise the possibility that the polymorphisms in the XPD gene may be contributing factors in the risk of BCC development. They are, therefore, important candidates for future studies in susceptibility to cancer."}

Our results revealed eight new exon skipping mutations in this exon: one directly altering the 5' splice site and seven affecting potential regulatory elements. This brings the number of splicing regulatory mutations detected in BRCA2 exon\u00a07 to a total of 11, a remarkably high number considering the total number of variants reported in this exon (n\u00a0=\u00a036), all tested in our minigene assay. We then exploited this large set of splicing data to test the predictive value of splicing regulator hexamers' scores recently established by Ke et al. (). Comparisons of hexamer-based predictions with our experimental data revealed high sensitivity in detecting variants that increased exon skipping, an important feature for prescreening variants before RNA analysis.

We investigated the association between genetic variation in TGFB1 and PMD using a cross-sectional study of 2,038 women who were members of the population-based Singapore Chinese Health Study cohort. We assessed PMD using a computer-assisted method. We used linear regression to examine the association between nine tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of TGFB1 and PMD and their interaction with parity, adjusting for age, BMI, and dialect group. We calculated P values adjusted for correlated tests (P(ACT)) to account for multiple testing. The strongest association was observed for rs2241716. Adjusted PMD was higher by 1.5% per minor allele (P(ACT) = 0.04). When stratifying by parity, this association was limited to nulliparous women. For nulliparous women, adjusted PMD was higher by 8.6% per minor allele (P(ACT) = 0.003; P for interaction with parity = 0.002). Three additional TGFB1 tagging SNPs, which were in linkage disequilibrium with rs2241716, were statistically significantly associated with adjusted PMD (P(ACT) < 0.05) for nulliparous women. However, none of these three SNPs showed statistically significant association after adjusting for rs2241716. Our data support that TGFB1 genetic variation may be an important genetic determinant of mammographic density measure that predicts breast cancer risk, particularly in nulliparous women."}

The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of DNA repair gene polymorphisms to GC risk and severe chronic atrophic gastritis (SCAG). Method A nested case control study within the EPIC cohort was performed including 246 gastric adenocarcinomas and 1175 matched controls. Controls with SCAG (n = 91), as defined by low pepsinogen A (PGA) levels, and controls with no SCAG (n = 1061) were also compared. Twelve polymorphisms at DNA repair genes (MSH2, MLH1, XRCC1, OGG1 and ERCC2) and TP53 gene were analysed. Antibodies against Helicobacter pylori were measured.\nNo association was observed for any of these polymorphisms with stomach cancer risk. However, ERCC2 K751Q polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for non-cardial neoplasm [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-3.12], being ERCC2 K751Q and D312N polymorphisms associated with the diffuse type. ERCC2 D312N (OR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.09-3.65) and K751Q alleles (OR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.01-3.30) and XRCC1 R399Q (OR = 1.69; 95% CI 1.02-2.79) allele were associated with an increased risk for SCAG.\nOur study supports a role of ERCC2 in non-cardial GC but not in cardial cancer. A concordant result was observed for subjects with low PGA levels. XRCC1 allele was associated also with SCAG. This is the first prospective study suggesting that individual variation in DNA repair may be relevant for gastric carcinogenesis, a finding that will require further confirmation validation in larger independent studies."}

CAD and ischemic stroke are both associated with atherosclerosis. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that rs1122608 is associated with ischemic stroke. Further studies were used to identify the most likely mechanism by which rs1122608 regulates atherosclerosis. For case-control association studies, two independent Chinese Han GeneID cohorts were used, including a Central cohort with 1,075 cases and 2,685 controls and the Northern cohort with 1,208 cases and 824 controls. eQTL and real-time RT-PCR analyses were used to identify the potential candidate gene(s) affected by rs1122608. The minor allele T of SNP rs1122608 showed significant association with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke in the Central GeneID cohort (adjusted P adj\u00a0=\u00a02.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4), OR 0.61). The association was replicated in an independent Northern GeneID cohort (P adj\u00a0=\u00a06.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-3), OR 0.69). The association became more significant in the combined population (P adj\u00a0=\u00a07.86\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-5), OR 0.73). Allele T of SNP rs1122608 also showed significant association with a decreased total cholesterol level (P adj\u00a0=\u00a00.013). Allele T of rs1122608 was associated with an increased expression level of SFRS3 encoding an mRNA splicing regulator, but not with the expression of BRG1/SMARCA4 or LDLR (located 36\u00a0kb from rs1122608). Increased expression of SFSR3 may decrease IL-1\u03b2 expression and secretion, resulting in reduced risk of atherosclerosis and stroke. This is the first study that demonstrates that rs1122608 confers protection against ischemic stroke and implicates splicing factor SFSR3 in the disease process."}

The primary objective of this study was to validate the association between two common variants in TGFB1 (rs1800470, rs1800471) and postcardiac transplant renal function. The secondary objective was to investigate the effect of candidate genes related to the RAAS, natriuretic peptides, and other elements involved in the intracellular signaling of these pathways.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of 158 heart transplant recipients treated with CNIs, and evaluated the association between select SNPs and the estimated glomerular filtration rate as calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease simplified formula. A total of 273 SNPs distributed in 44 genes were tested.\nNo association was observed between TGFB1 variants and renal function. One polymorphism in the protein kinase C-\u03b2 gene (PRKCB; rs11074606), which is implicated in the RAAS intracellular signaling, was significantly associated with post-transplant estimated glomerular filtration rate after adjusting for possible confounders (P=0.00049). This marker is in linkage disequilibrium with two variants located in putative regulatory regions of the gene (rs2283541, rs1013316).\nOur results suggest that PRKCB may be a potential predictor of CNI-induced nephrotoxicity in heart transplant recipients, and could therefore be a promising candidate to identify patients who are most susceptible to this adverse drug reaction."}

The disease is the result not only of several environmental risk factors, but also of genetic predisposition. To take advantage of recent advances in gene-mapping technology, we executed a genome-wide association scan to identify genetic variants associated with obesity-related quantitative traits in the genetically isolated population of Sardinia. Initial analysis suggested that several SNPs in the FTO and PFKP genes were associated with increased BMI, hip circumference, and weight. Within the FTO gene, rs9930506 showed the strongest association with BMI (p = 8.6 x10(-7)), hip circumference (p = 3.4 x 10(-8)), and weight (p = 9.1 x 10(-7)). In Sardinia, homozygotes for the rare \"G\" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.46) were 1.3 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common \"A\" allele. Within the PFKP gene, rs6602024 showed very strong association with BMI (p = 4.9 x 10(-6)). Homozygotes for the rare \"A\" allele of this SNP (minor allele frequency = 0.12) were 1.8 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the common \"G\" allele. To replicate our findings, we genotyped these two SNPs in the GenNet study. In European Americans (N = 1,496) and in Hispanic Americans (N = 839), we replicated significant association between rs9930506 in the FTO gene and BMI (p-value for meta-analysis of European American and Hispanic American follow-up samples, p = 0.001), weight (p = 0.001), and hip circumference (p = 0.0005). We did not replicate association between rs6602024 and obesity-related traits in the GenNet sample, although we found that in European Americans, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, homozygotes for the rare \"A\" allele were, on average, 1.0-3.0 BMI units heavier than homozygotes for the more common \"G\" allele. In summary, we have completed a whole genome-association scan for three obesity-related quantitative traits and report that common genetic variants in the FTO gene are associated with substantial changes in BMI, hip circumference, and body weight. These changes could have a significant impact on the risk of obesity-related morbidity in the general population."}

DNA repair is an essential system that prevents accumulation of mutations which can lead to serious cellular malfunctions. Phenotypic evaluation of DNA repair activity of individuals is a relatively new approach. Methods to assess base and nucleotide excision repair pathways (BER and NER) in peripheral blood cells based on modified comet assay protocols have been widely applied in human epidemiological studies. These provided some interesting observations of individual DNA repair activity being suppressed among cancer patients. However, extension of these results to cancer target tissues requires a different approach. Here we describe the evaluation of BER and NER activities in extracts from deep-frozen colon biopsies using an upgraded version of the in vitro comet-based DNA repair assay in which 12 reactions on one microscope slide can be performed. The aim of this report is to provide a detailed, easy-to-follow protocol together with results of optimization experiments. Additionally, results obtained by functional assays were analyzed in the context of other cellular biomarkers, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expressions. We have shown that measuring DNA repair activity is not easily replaceable by genomic or transcriptomic approaches, but should be applied with the latter techniques in a complementary manner. The ability to measure DNA repair directly in cancer target tissues might finally answer questions about the tissue-specificity of DNA repair processes and their real involvement in the process of carcinogenesis."}

Five patients had VACTERL-H association. Leukaemia was reported in 13 patients, and solid tumours in 15; 6 patients had two or more malignancies. The cumulative probability of any malignancy was 97% by age 5.2 years. IVS7+1G-->A and IVS7+2T-->G were associated with AML, and 886delGT and 6174delT with brain tumours. However, patients with other alleles remained at very high risk of these events. Missense mutations formed a distinct cluster in a highly conserved region of the BRCA2 protein. The small group of patients with biallelic mutations in BRCA2 is distinctive in the severity of the phenotype, and early onset and high rates of leukaemia and specific solid tumours, and may comprise an extreme variant of Fanconi anaemia. Several of the alleles were not associated with cancer in presumed carriers, and thus counselling presents more uncertainties than usual."}

The SPINK5 gene is expressed on epithelial surfaces and may provide protection against other allergenic serine proteases. Mutations in the SPINK5 gene result in Netherton syndrome, a disorder characterised by AD, ichthyosis, and elevated serum IgE levels. We genotyped 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the SPINK5 gene for 1090 case-control samples (631 patients with AD and 459 normal controls) and analysed the SNPs and haplotypes in this gene and also searched for gene-gene interactions between SPINK5 and the DEFB1 gene that we previously reported. Six SNPs [rs17718511 (P = 0.026), rs17860502 (P = 0.024), KN0001820 (P = 0.045), rs60978485 (P = 0.007), rs17718737 (P = 0.02), and rs1422985 (P = 0.038)] and the haplotype TAA (rs60978485, rs6892205, rs2303064; P = 0.023) in the SPINK5 gene showed significant different allelic or genotypic distributions between the AD group and the control group.

Hemoptysis and pneumothorax are complications commonly reported in patients with cystic fibrosis.\nThis document presents the CF Foundation's Pulmonary Therapies Committee recommendations for the treatment of hemoptysis and pneumothorax.\nThe committee recognized that insufficient data exist to develop evidence-based recommendations and so used the Delphi technique to formalize an expert panel's consensus process and develop explicit care recommendations.\nThe expert panel completed the survey twice, allowing refinement of recommendations. Numeric responses to the questions were summarized and applied to a priori definitions to determine levels of consensus. Recommendations were then developed to practical treatment questions based upon the median scores and the degree of consensus.\nThese recommendations for the management of the patient with CF with hemoptysis and pneumothorax are designed for general use in most individuals but should be adapted to meet specific needs as determined by the individuals, their families, and their health care providers. It is hoped that the guidelines provided in this manuscript will facilitate the appropriate application of these treatments to improve and extend the lives of all individuals with cystic fibrosis."}

Data from pilot studies and public policy discourse have led to recommendations by some professional organizations that CF screening should be offered or made available to pregnant women and their partners, and to couples planning a pregnancy. It is crucial that genetic counselors gain thorough understanding of the complexities of CF and the implications of positive test results, so that they may serve as a reliable, educated referral base and resource for health care providers and their patients. While not all pregnant women will be referred for genetic counseling prior to CF carrier testing, genetic counselors often will be asked to counsel clients after they have a positive test result, or who are found to be at increased risk. Genetic counselors can play an important role in providing accurate and current information as well as support for patients' informed decisions. These recommendations were created by a multicenter working group of genetic counselors with expertise in CF and are based on personal clinical experience, review of pertinent English language medical articles, and reports of expert committees. The recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome.

Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations, laboratory testing is categorized on the basis of the level of testing complexity as either waived (i.e., from routine regulatory oversight) or nonwaived testing (which includes tests of moderate and high complexity). Laboratories that perform biochemical genetic testing are required by CLIA regulations to meet the general quality systems requirements for nonwaived testing and the personnel requirements for high-complexity testing. Laboratories that perform public health newborn screening are subject to the same CLIA regulations and applicable state requirements. As the number of inherited metabolic diseases that are included in state-based newborn screening programs continues to increase, ensuring the quality of performance and delivery of testing services remains a continuous challenge not only for public health laboratories and other newborn screening facilities but also for biochemical genetic testing laboratories. To help ensure the quality of laboratory testing, CDC collaborated with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health to develop guidelines for laboratories to meet CLIA requirements and apply additional quality assurance measures for these areas of genetic testing. This report provides recommendations for good laboratory practices that were developed based on recommendations from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee, with additional input from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society; the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children; and representatives of newborn screening laboratories. The recommended practices address the benefits of using a quality management system approach, factors to consider before introducing new tests, establishment and verification of test performance specifications, the total laboratory testing process (which consists of the preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic phases), confidentiality of patient information and test results, and personnel qualifications and responsibilities for laboratory testing for inherited metabolic diseases. These recommendations are intended for laboratories that perform biochemical genetic testing to improve the quality of laboratory services and for newborn screening laboratories to ensure the quality of laboratory practices for inherited metabolic disorders. These recommendations also are intended as a resource for medical and public health professionals who evaluate laboratory practices, for users of laboratory services to facilitate their collaboration with newborn screening systems and use of biochemical genetic tests, and for standard-setting organizations and professional societies in developing future laboratory quality standards and practice recommendations. This report complements Good Laboratory Practices for Molecular Genetic Testing for Heritable Diseases and Conditions (CDC. Good laboratory practices for molecular genetic testing for heritable diseases and conditions. MMWR 2009;58 [No. RR-6]) to provide guidance for ensuring and improving the quality of genetic laboratory services and public health outcomes. Future recommendations for additional areas of genetic testing will be considered on the basis of continued monitoring and evaluation of laboratory practices, technology advancements, and the development of laboratory standards and guidelines."}

Our results show that gene promoters have an open chromatin structure that is enhanced upon transcriptional activation but the Xa and the Xi have similar overall 30 nm chromatin fiber structures. Therefore, the formation of facultative heterochromatin is dependent on factors that act at a level above the 30 nm fiber and transcription does not alter bulk chromatin fiber structures. However, large-scale chromatin structures on Xa are decondensed compared with the Xi and transcription inhibition is sufficient to promote large-scale chromatin compaction. We show a link between transcription and large-scale chromatin packaging independent of the bulk 30 nm chromatin fiber and propose that transcription, not the global compaction of 30 nm chromatin fibers, determines the cytological appearance of large-scale chromatin structures."}

No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance either in the MDD2000+ study, or in meta-analysis with two other studies totaling 5763 cases and 6901 controls. These results imply that common variants of intermediate or large effect do not have main effects in the genetic architecture of MDD. Suggestive but notable results were (a) gene-based tests suggesting roles for adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3, 2p23.3) and galanin (GAL, 11q13.3); published functional evidence relates both of these to MDD and serotonergic signaling; (b) support for the bipolar disorder risk variant SNP rs1006737 in CACNA1C (P=0.020, odds ratio=1.10); and (c) lack of support for rs2251219, a SNP identified in a meta-analysis of affective disorder studies (P=0.51). We estimate that sample sizes 1.8- to 2.4-fold greater are needed for association studies of MDD compared with those for schizophrenia to detect variants that explain the same proportion of total variance in liability. Larger study cohorts characterized for genetic and environmental risk factors accumulated prospectively are likely to be needed to dissect more fully the etiology of MDD."}

XPD genotypes were measured by PCR-RFLP. DNA repair proficiency was assessed using a cytogenetic assay that detects X-ray induced chromatid aberrations (breaks and gaps). Chromatid aberrations were scored per 100 metaphase cells following incubation at 37 degrees C (1.5 h after irradiation) to allow for repair of DNA damage. Individuals with the Lys/Lys codon 751 XPD genotype had a higher number of chromatid aberrations (132/100 metaphase cells) than those having a 751Gln allele (34/100 metaphase cells). Individuals having greater than 60 chromatid breaks plus gaps were categorized as having sub-optimal repair. Possessing a Lys/Lys751 genotype increased the risk of sub-optimal DNA repair (odds ratio = 7.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-87.7). The Asp312Asn XPD polymorphism did not appear to affect DNA repair proficiency. These results suggest that the Lys751 (common) allele may alter the XPD protein product resulting in sub-optimal repair of X-ray-induced DNA damage."}

Our results showed that rs2303070 T allele of SPINK5 (assuming recessive model; OR=3.58, 95% CI 1.63-7.84; P=0.0014) and rs7977932\u2003G allele of IL-31 (assuming recessive model; OR=18.25, 95% CI\u2003=3.27-101.94; P=0.0009) were associated with increased risks of developing atopic eczema, while rs6892205\u2003G allele of SPINK5 (assuming dominant model; OR=3.79, 95% CI 1.55-9.28; P=0.0036) was associated with the development of non-atopic hand dermatitis. In summary, our results showed that distinct SPINK5 and IL-31 gene variants were associated with the development of atopic eczema and non-atopic hand dermatitis. The barrier function, particularly those regulated by SPINK5, may play an important role in the development of both atopic eczema and non-atopic hand dermatitis."}

However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the relevance of these genetic variations remains to be fully established. In this study, we analyzed 42 genetic variations among 15 candidate genes in 307 AML patients and 560 age-sex matched controls. Their associations with chemotherapy response were further evaluated in combination with other well-established prognostic factors. An increased risk of AML was found in individuals heterozygous for XPD 2251A>C (rs13181) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.637 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.118-2.395), and the increased risk could be attributed to C allele (OR = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.061-2.134). Postchemotherapy response analysis revealed that AML patients heterozygous for ATM 4138C>T (rs3092856) or GG homozygous for TP53 215C>G (rs1042522) were independently linked to inferior treatment outcomes. These results uncover novel prognostic factors for AML patients treated with chemotherapy and may also indicate an etiological role of XPD in this disease."}

We considered the following genes involved in DNA-repair pathways: base excision repair (OGG1 Ser326Cys, XRCC1 Trp194Arg and Arg399Gln); nucleotide excision repair [XPA (-4)G/A, XPC C/A (i11) and A33512C (Lys939Gln), XPD Asp312Asn and A18911C (Lys751Gln), XPF Arg415Gln, XPG Asp1104His, ERCC1 C118T]; homologous recombination repair [NBS1 Glu185Gln, Rad51 135G/C, XRCC3 C18067 (Thr241Met)]. The study group consisted of 133 patients diagnosed with sporadic CRC, while the control group was composed of 100 age-matched non-cancer volunteers. Genotyping was performed by PCR and PCR-RFLP. Fisher's exact test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was used. We found that: (i) XPC C/A (i11) heterozygous variant is associated with increased risk of CRC [OR is 2.07 (95% CI 1.1391, 3.7782) P=0.038], (ii) XPD A18911C (Lys751Gln) is associated with decreased risk of CRC [OR=0.4497, (95% CI 0.2215, 0.9131) P=0.031] for an individual with at least one A allele at this locus.

Therefore, genetic variation in DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility to CBP in the exposed population. Since benzene-induced DNA damages include DNA adducts, we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of ERCC1 (Excision repair cross complementation group 1) and ERCC2/XPD (Excision repair cross complementation group 2/xeroderma pigmentosum group D) are associated with the risk of CBP. A case-control study involving 102 benzene-poisoned patients and 204 none-benzene-poisoned controls occupationally exposed to benzene was carried out in the Northeast region of China. The polymorphisms of codon 118 (rs11615) and C8092A (rs3212986) of ERCC1, codon 751 (rs13181), 312 (rs1799793) and 156 (rs238406) of ERCC2/XPD were genotyped by TaqMan(\u00ae) Real-time PCR. The results showed that individuals carrying the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype had an increased risk of CBP (OR(adj)=3.390; 95%CI: 1.393-8.253; P=0.007) comparing with its CC genotype. After stratified by smoking, gender and exposure duration we found that the increased risk of CBP associated with the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype confined to nonsmokers (OR=3.214; 95% CI: 1.359-7.601; P=0.006), female (OR=3.049; 95% CI: 1.235-7.529; P=0.013) and exposure duration> 12 years (OR=3.750; 95% CI: 1.041-13.513; P=0.035). Since ERCC1 and ERCC2/XPD are both located on chromosome 19q13.3, haplotype analysis of all 5 SNPs was also conducted. However no correlations between the risks of CBP and other genotypes or haplotypes were found. Therefore, our findings suggest an important role of ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphisms for a biomarker to CBP in the Chinese occupational population."}

Several studies investigated the role of DNA repair genetic variants in cancer susceptibility, but only few studies investigated their role in survival and response to chemotherapy for bladder cancer. We genotyped 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in DNA repair genes in 456 bladder cancer patients, reconstructed haplotypes and calculated a score for combinations of the SNPs. We estimated Hazard Ratios (adjHR) for time to death. Among patients treated with chemotherapy, variant alleles of five SNPs in the XRCC1 gene conferred better survival (rs915927 adjHR 0.55 (95%CI 0.32-0.94); rs76507 adjHR 0.48 (95%CI 0.27-0.84); rs2854501 adjHR 0.25 (95%CI 0.12-0.52); rs2854509 adjHR 0.21 (95%CI 0.09-0.46); rs3213255 adjHR 0.46 (95%CI 0.26-0.80). In this group of patients, an increasing number of variant alleles in a XRCC1 gene score were associated with a better survival (26% decrease of risk of death for each additional variant allele in XRCC1). By functional analyses we demonstrated that the previous XRCC1 SNPs confer lower DNA repair capacity. This may support the hypothesis that survival in these patients may be modulated by the different DNA repair capacity determined by genetic variants. Chemotherapy treated cancer patients bearing an increasing number of \"risky\" alleles in XRCC1 gene had a better survival, suggesting that a proficient DNA repair may result in resistance to therapy and shorter survival. This finding may have clinical implications for the choice of therapy."}

We compared our results with those from the databases and other published studies. Of the 41 SNPs, 8 were monomorphic in our sample. Twelve were reported for the first time for Caucasians and the other 29 SNPs in our sample essentially confirmed the respective allele frequencies for Caucasians in the databases and previous studies. The comparison of our data with other ethnic groups showed significant differentiation between the three major world ethnic groups at some SNPs (Caucasians and Africans differed at 3 of the 18 shared SNPs, and Caucasians and Asians differed at 13 of the 22 shared SNPs). This genetic differentiation may have an important implication for studying the well-known ethnic differences in the prevalence of obesity and osteoporosis, and complex disorders in general.\nA comparative analysis of the SNP data of the candidate genes obtained in the present study, as well as those retrieved from the public domain, suggests that the databases may currently have serious limitations for studying complex disorders with an ethnic-dependent background due to the incomplete and uneven representation of the candidate SNPs in the databases for the major ethnic groups. This conclusion attests to the imperative necessity of large-scale and accurate characterization of these SNPs in different ethnic groups."}

The cause of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is unknown, but there is an association with childhood febrile seizures. Several rarer epilepsies featuring febrile seizures are caused by mutations in SCN1A, which encodes a brain-expressed sodium channel subunit targeted by many anti-epileptic drugs. We undertook a genome-wide association study in 1018 people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 7552 control subjects, with validation in an independent sample set comprising 959 people with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and 3591 control subjects. To dissect out variants related to a history of febrile seizures, we tested cases with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with (overall n = 757) and without (overall n = 803) a history of febrile seizures. Meta-analysis revealed a genome-wide significant association for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis with febrile seizures at the sodium channel gene cluster on chromosome 2q24.3 [rs7587026, within an intron of the SCN1A gene, P = 3.36 \u00d7 10(-9), odds ratio (A) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval: 1.26-1.59].

Our objective was to assess this SNP in relation to the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin-based preoperative radiochemotherapy in a multicenter clinical trial (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1201). As a secondary aim, we investigated the rate of allelic imbalance between germline and tumor DNA.\nEighty-one eligible treatment-na\u00efve subjects with newly diagnosed resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma received radiotherapy (45 Gy) concurrent with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, with planned subsequent surgical resection. The primary endpoint was pCR, defined as complete absence of tumor in the surgical specimen after radiochemotherapy. Using germline DNA from 60 subjects, we examined the base-excision repair SNP, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and 4 other SNPs in nucleotide excision (XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn, ERCC1 3' flank) and double-stranded break (XRCC2 5' flank) repair pathways, and correlated genotype with pCR rate. Paired tumor tissue was used to estimate the frequency of allelic imbalance at the XRCC1 SNP.\nThe variant allele of the XRCC1 SNP (399Gln) was detected in 52% of subjects. Only 6% of subjects with the variant allele experienced a pCR, compared to 28% of subjects without the variant allele (odds ratio 5.37 for failing to achieve pCR, p = 0.062). Allelic imbalance at this locus was found in only 10% of informative subjects, suggesting that germline genotype may reflect tumor genotype at this locus. No significant association with pCR was noted for other SNPs.\nAssessed for the first time in a prospective, interventional trial cohort of esophageal adenocarcinoma, XRCC1 399Gln was associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy. Further investigation of this genetic variation is warranted in larger cohorts. In addition, these data indicate that germline genotype may serve as a surrogate for tumor genotype at this locus."}

Finally, we have compared the prevalence of the variants in the hearing impaired population with the general population.\nAlthough a high heterogeneity of sequence variation was observed in patients and controls, the 35delG mutation remains the most common pathogenic mutation in our population. Genetic counseling is dependent on the knowledge of the pathogenicity of the mutations and remains difficult in a number of cases. By comparing the sequence variations observed in hearing impaired patients with those sequence variants observed in general population, from the same ethnic background, we show that the M34T, V37I and R127H variants can not be responsible for profound or severe deafness."}

The SMARCA2 gene encodes BRM in the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to schizophrenia were found in two linkage disequilibrium blocks in the SMARCA2 gene after screening of 11 883 SNPs (rs2296212; overall allelic P = 5.8 x 10(-5)) and subsequent screening of 22 genes involved in chromatin remodeling (rs3793490; overall allelic P = 2.0 x 10(-6)) in a Japanese population. A risk allele of a missense polymorphism (rs2296212) induced a lower nuclear localization efficiency of BRM, and risk alleles of intronic polymorphisms (rs3763627 and rs3793490) were associated with low SMARCA2 expression levels in the postmortem prefrontal cortex. A significant correlation in the fold changes of gene expression from schizophrenic prefrontal cortex (from the Stanley Medical Research Institute online genomics database) was seen with suppression of SMARCA2 in transfected human cells by specific siRNA, and of orthologous genes in the prefrontal cortex of Smarca2 knockout mice. Smarca2 knockout mice showed impaired social interaction and prepulse inhibition. Psychotogenic drugs lowered Smarca2 expression while antipsychotic drugs increased it in the mouse brain. These findings support the existence of a role for BRM in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."}

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes can impact protein function leading to genomic instability facilitated by growth stimulation and increased cancer risk. Thus, 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes involved in base excision repair (XRCC1, APEX, POLD1), BRCA1 protein interaction (BRIP1, ZNF350, BRCA2), and growth regulation (TGFss1, IGFBP3) were evaluated.\nGenomic DNA samples were used in Taqman 5'-nuclease assays for most SNPs. Breast cancer risk to ages 50 and 70 were estimated using the kin-cohort method in which genotypes of relatives are inferred based on the known genotype of the index subject and Mendelian inheritance patterns. Family cancer history data was collected from a series of genotyped breast cancer cases (N = 748) identified within a cohort of female US radiologic technologists. Among 2,430 female first-degree relatives of cases, 190 breast cancers were reported.\nGenotypes associated with increased risk were: XRCC1 R194W (WW and RW vs. RR, cumulative risk up to age 70, risk ratio (RR) = 2.3; 95% CI 1.3-3.8); XRCC1 R399Q (QQ vs. RR, cumulative risk up to age 70, RR = 1.9; 1.1-3.9); and BRIP1 (or BACH1) P919S (SS vs. PP, cumulative risk up to age 50, RR = 6.9; 1.6-29.3). The risk for those heterozygous for BRCA2 N372H and APEX D148E were significantly lower than risks for homozygotes of either allele, and these were the only two results that remained significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. No associations with breast cancer were observed for: APEX Q51H; XRCC1 R280H; IGFPB3 -202A>C; TGFss1 L10P, P25R, and T263I; BRCA2 N289H and T1915M; BRIP1 -64A>C; and ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) 1845C>T, L66P, R501S, and S472P.\nSome variants in genes within the base-excision repair pathway (XRCC1) and BRCA1 interacting proteins (BRIP1) may play a role as low penetrance breast cancer risk alleles. Previous association studies of breast cancer and BRCA2 N372H and functional observations for APEX D148E ran counter to our findings of decreased risks. Due to the many comparisons, cautious interpretation and replication of these relationships are warranted."}

Through a detailed population genomic analysis of existing genomewide data sets and new resequencing data obtained in geographically diverse populations, we find that the signature of selection at ALMS1 is considerably more complex than what would be expected for an idealized model of a selective sweep acting on a newly arisen advantageous mutation. Specifically, we observed three highly divergent and globally dispersed haplogroups, two of which carry a set of seven derived nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms that are nearly fixed in Asian populations. Our data suggest that the interaction of human demographic history and positive selection on standing variation in Eurasian populations approximately 15 thousand years ago parsimoniously explains the spectrum of extant ALMS1 variation. These results provide new insights into the evolutionary history of ALMS1 in humans and suggest that selective events identified in genomewide scans may be more complex than currently appreciated."}

Toxoplasma gondii acquired by the mother can be transmitted to the fetus. Infants with the most severe clinical signs in brain and eye are those infected early in pregnancy when fetal immunity is least well developed. Genetic analysis could provide unique insight into events in utero that are otherwise difficult to determine. We tested the hypothesis that propensity for T. gondii to cause eye disease is associated with genes previously implicated in congenital or juvenile onset ocular disease. Using mother-child pairs from Europe (EMSCOT) and child/parent trios from North America (NCCCTS), we demonstrated that ocular and brain disease in congenital toxoplasmosis associate with polymorphisms in ABCA4 encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily A, member 4 previously associated with juvenile onset retinal dystrophies including Stargardt's disease. Polymorphisms at COL2A1 encoding type II collagen, previously associated with Stickler syndrome, associated only with ocular disease in congenital toxoplasmosis. Experimental studies showed that both ABCA4 and COL2A1 show isoform-specific epigenetic modifications consistent with imprinting, which provided an explanation for the patterns of inheritance observed. These genetic and epigenetic risk factors provide unique insight into molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of disease."}

To date, mutations in 13 known genes and at two other loci have been implicated in LCA causation. An examination of the known genes highlights several processes which, when defective, cause LCA, including photoreceptor development and maintenance, phototransduction, vitamin A metabolism, and protein trafficking. In addition, it has been known for some time that defects in sensory cilia can cause syndromes involving hereditary blindness. More recently evidence has come to light that non-syndromic LCA can also be a \"ciliopathy.\"\nHere we present a homozygosity mapping analysis in a consanguineous sibship that led to the identification of a mutation in the recently discovered LCA5 gene. Homozygosity mapping was done using Affymetrix 10K Xba I Gene Chip and a 24.5cM region on chromosome 6 (6q12- q16.3) was identified to be significantly homozygous. The LCA5 gene on this region was sequenced and cDNA sequencing also done to characterize the mutation.\nA c.955G>A missense mutation in the last base of exon 6 causing disruption of the splice donor site was identified in both the affected sibs. Since there is a second consensus splice donor sequence 5 bp into the adjacent intron, this mutation results in a transcript with a 5 bp insertion of intronic sequence, leading to a frameshift and premature truncation.\nWe report a missense mutation functionally altering the splice donor site and leading to a truncated protein. This is the second report of LCA5 mutations causing LCA. It may also be significant that one affected child died at eleven months of age due to asphyxia during sleep. To date the only phenotype unambiguously associated with mutations in this gene is LCA. However the LCA5 gene is known to be expressed in nasopharynx, trachea and lungs and was originally identified in the proteome of bronchial epithelium ciliary axonemes. The cause of death in this child may therefore imply that LCA5 mutations can in fact cause a wider spectrum of phenotypes including respiratory disease."}

We have established a simple, versatile and reliable assay to test for the functional significance of mutations in BRCA2 using mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells) and bacterial artificial chromosomes and have used it to classify 17 sequence variants. The assay is based on the ability of human BRCA2 to complement the loss of endogenous Brca2 in mouse ES cells. This technique may also serve as a paradigm for functional analysis of mutations found in other genes linked to human diseases."}

Here, we studied the frequency of this allele and found it to be among the most common genetic causes of inherited ataxia in Finland. We identified 27 patients with mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) from 15 Finnish families, with a carrier frequency in the general population of 1 : 125. Since the mutation pair W748S+E1143G has also been described in European patients, we examined the haplotypes of 13 non-Finnish, European patients with the W748S mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that all the chromosomes carrying these two changes, in patients from Finland, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, originate from a common ancient founder. In Finland and Norway, long, common, northern haplotypes, outside the core haplotype, could be identified. Despite having identical homozygous mutations, the Finnish patients with this adult- or juvenile-onset disease had surprisingly heterogeneous phenotypes, albeit with a characteristic set of features, including ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria, mild cognitive impairment, involuntary movements, psychiatric symptoms, and epileptic seizures. The high carrier frequency in Finland, the high number of patients in Norway, and the ancient European founder chromosome indicate that this newly identified ataxia should be considered in the first-line differential diagnosis of progressive ataxia syndromes."}

These play a key role in epilepsy, with the most commonly mutated gene in epilepsy being SCN1A. We examined whether polymorphisms in the above genes affect epilepsy risk in 1,529 epilepsy patients and 1,935 controls from four ethnicities or locations: Malay, Indian, and Chinese, all from Malaysia, and Chinese from Hong Kong. Of patients, 19\u00a0% were idiopathic, 42\u00a0% symptomatic, and 40\u00a0% cryptogenic. We genotyped 43 polymorphisms: 27 in Hong Kong, 28 in Malaysia, and 12 in both locations. The strongest association with epilepsy was rs3812718, or SCN1A IVS5N+5G>A: odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.85 for allele G (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009) and 0.73 for genotype GG versus AA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

To investigate whether common genetic variants modify penetrance for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we undertook a two-staged genome-wide association study in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stage 1 using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, 592,163 filtered SNPs genotyped were available on 899 young (<40 years) affected and 804 unaffected carriers of European ancestry. Associations were evaluated using a survival-based score test adjusted for familial correlations and stratified by country of the study and BRCA2*6174delT mutation status. The genomic inflation factor (\u03bb) was 1.011. The stage 1 association analysis revealed multiple variants associated with breast cancer risk: 3 SNPs had p-values<10(-5) and 39 SNPs had p-values<10(-4). These variants included several previously associated with sporadic breast cancer risk and two novel loci on chromosome 20 (rs311499) and chromosome 10 (rs16917302). The chromosome 10 locus was in ZNF365, which contains another variant that has recently been associated with breast cancer in an independent study of unselected cases. In stage 2, the top 85 loci from stage 1 were genotyped in 1,264 cases and 1,222 controls. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for stage 1 and 2 were combined and estimated using a retrospective likelihood approach, stratified by country of residence and the most common mutation, BRCA2*6174delT. The combined per allele HR of the minor allele for the novel loci rs16917302 was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.86, ) and for rs311499 was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.85, ). FGFR2 rs2981575 had the strongest association with breast cancer risk (per allele HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39, ). These results indicate that SNPs that modify BRCA2 penetrance identified by an agnostic approach thus far are limited to variants that also modify risk of sporadic BRCA2 wild-type breast cancer."}

While the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine did not produce survival benefit compared to single-agent gemcitabine in prospective trials it is postulated that the addition of DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin to standard gemcitabine chemotherapy should be considered in known BRCA mutation carriers. We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 60-year-old carrier of a rare BRCA2 (1153insertionT) germline mutation. The patient received gemcitabine without any response and actually progression of the disease had occurred. Therefore cisplatin was added in combination with gemcitabine. A dramatic complete response to therapy was encountered with no evidence of disease in both CT scans and markers (CA19-9). In conclusion, in patients with known BRCA mutation associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin should be considered. Physicians should consider BRCA mutation testing when the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is established, especially when the patient belongs to an ethnic group where founder mutations exist, and/or there is strong personal or family history of cancer. This may be applied also to other metastatic tumors diagnosed in BRCA1/2 carriers."}

The sample included 172 trios (parents and offspring), and all subjects were genotyped for several single-nucleotide polymorphisms covering CC2D1A and CC2D2A. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that the rs6511901 and rs10410239 polymorphisms of CC2D1A were in strong LD (D'=0.865), and haplotype analysis showed evidence for over-transmission from parents to MR offspring (p=0.0009). The LD analysis also revealed that CC2D2A single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs10025837, rs13116304, and rs7661102 were in strong LD (D'=0.848), and haplotype analysis showed significant transmission disequilibrium (p=0.0004). The results suggest the involvement of CC2D1A and CC2D2A in MR in the Han Chinese population, and some specific haplotypes may be susceptible or protective."}

ASOH-NGCE can be applied to multiplex SNP loci genotyping with excellent separation of hybridization mixtures. Average relative standard deviations (RSDs) were low for within-day (1.10%) and between-day (2.41%) reproducibility. Moreover, the allele frequencies in pooled DNAs were accurately determined from peak areas and equilibrium dissociation constants. Our method was highly sensitive in detecting alleles with frequency as low as 1% and in distinguishing allele frequencies differing by 1% between pools. The average value of differences between real and estimated frequencies (accuracy) was only 0.004."}

Several low penetrance susceptibility genes associated with malignant melanoma (MM) have been described, including genes related to pigmentation, DNA damage repair and oxidative stress pathways. In the present work, we conducted a candidate gene association study based on proteins and genes whose expression we had detected altered in melanoma cell lines as compared to normal melanocytes. The result was the selection of 88 loci and 384 SNPs, of which 314 fulfilled our quality criteria for a case-control association study. The SNP rs6854854 in ANXA5 was statistically significant after conservative Bonferroni correction when 464 melanoma patients and 400 controls were analyzed in a discovery Phase I. However, this finding could not be replicated in the validation phase, perhaps because the minor allele frequency of SNP rs6854854 varies depending on the geographical region considered. Additionally, a second SNP (rs6431588) located on ILKAP was found to be associated with melanoma after considering a combined set of 1,883 MM cases and 1,358 disease-free controls. The OR was 1.29 (95% CI 1.12-1.48; p-value\u200a=\u200a4\u00d710-4). Both SNPs, rs6854854 in ANXA5 and rs6431588 in ILKAP, show population structure, which, assuming that the Spanish population is not significantly structured, suggests a role of these loci on a specific genetic adaptation to different environmental conditions. Furthermore, the biological relevance of these genes in MM is supported by in vitro experiments, which show a decrease in the transcription levels of ANXA5 and ILKAP in melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes."}

We also identified 15 novel SNPs associated with severity of tubulitis scores, after adjusting for transplant center and other clinical factors independently associated with severity of tubulitis (P<0.05). There was some overlap with one SNP associated with AR and also associated with severity of tubulitis, among the top 15 SNPs.\nCenter-to-center variation is a major challenge to genomic studies focused on AR.

It is generally thought that the associated markers reflect the effect of a nearby common (minor allele frequency >0.05) causal site, which is associated with the marker, leading to extensive resequencing efforts to find causal sites. We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create \"synthetic associations\" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele. Although synthetic associations are an obvious theoretical possibility, they have never been systematically explored as a possible explanation for GWAS findings. Here, we use simple computer simulations to show the conditions under which such synthetic associations will arise and how they may be recognized. We show that they are not only possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies. We also illustrate the behavior of synthetic associations in real datasets by showing that rare causal mutations responsible for both hearing loss and sickle cell anemia create genome-wide significant synthetic associations, in the latter case extending over a 2.5-Mb interval encompassing scores of \"blocks\" of associated variants. In conclusion, uncommon or rare genetic variants can easily create synthetic associations that are credited to common variants, and this possibility requires careful consideration in the interpretation and follow up of GWAS signals."}

We investigated the associations of biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR), leucopenia, cytomegalovirus infections and other infections with these IMPDH polymorphisms, as well as with demographic, biological and treatment data using multivariate analysis.\nMany IMPDH II variant alleles referenced in Genbank were not detected and no new polymorphisms were identified. In the whole group of 456 patients, the IMPDH I rs2278294 SNP was associated with a lower risk of BPAR and a higher risk of leucopenia over the first year post-transplantation. No other IMPDH I or IMPDH II polymorphism was significantly associated with any clinical outcome. Interestingly, calcineurin inhibitor and MPA exposures below the therapeutic range increased the risk of BPAR. Cytomegalovirus infection was the factor most closely linked with leucopenia, whereas tacrolimus was associated with fewer infections than cyclosporine.\nIMPDH II genotyping may not improve MPA treatment outcome over the first year post-transplantation, in contrast to MPA and calcineurine inhibitor therapeutic drug monitoring and IMPDH I genotyping."}

Sequence alterations in CACNA1F lead to the incomplete type of CSNB (CSNB2), which can be distinguished by standard electroretinography (ERG). CSNB2 is associated with a reduced rod b-wave, a substantially reduced cone a-wave, and a reduced 30-Hz flicker ERG response. CACNA1F encodes the alpha 1-subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.4 alpha ), which is specific to photoreceptors and is present at high density in the synaptic terminals. Ten of our patients with CSNB2 showed no mutation in CACNA1F. To identify the disease-causing mutations, we used a candidate-gene approach. CABP4, a member of the calcium-binding protein (CABP) family, is located in photoreceptor synaptic terminals and is directly associated with the C-terminal domain of the Cav1.4 alpha . Mice lacking either Cabp4 or Cav1.4 alpha display a CSNB2-like phenotype. Here, we report for the first time that mutations in CABP4 lead to autosomal recessive CSNB. Our studies revealed homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in two families. We also show that these mutations reduce the transcript levels to 30%-40% of those in controls. This suggests that the reduced amount of CABP4 is the reason for the signaling defect in these patients."}

Single SNPs and haplotypes, including the H1 haplotype, were evaluated for association to PD. Relative quantification of gene expression was performed using real-time RT-PCR.\nAfter adjusting for multiple comparisons, SNP rs1800547 was significantly associated with PD affection. While the H1 haplotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for PD, a novel H1 subhaplotype was identified that predicted a greater increased risk for PD. The expression of 4-repeat MAPT, STH, and KIAA1267 was significantly increased in PD brains relative to controls. No difference in expression was observed for 3-repeat MAPT.\nThis study supports a role for MAPT in the pathogenesis of familial and idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). Interestingly, the results of the gene expression studies suggest that other genes in the vicinity of MAPT, specifically STH and KIAA1267, may also have a role in PD and suggest complex effects for the genes in this region on PD risk."}

After all quality control checks, the analysis of 707 European-ancestry families included 1615 affected and 1602 unaffected genotyped individuals, and the analysis of all 807 families included 1900 affected and 1839 unaffected individuals. Multipoint linkage analysis with correction for marker-marker linkage disequilibrium was carried out with 5861 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Illumina version 4.0 linkage map). Suggestive evidence for linkage (European families) was observed on chromosomes 8p21, 8q24.1, 9q34 and 12q24.1 in nonparametric and/or parametric analyses. In a logistic regression allele-sharing analysis of linkage allowing for intersite heterogeneity, genomewide significant evidence for linkage was observed on chromosome 10p12. Significant heterogeneity was also observed on chromosome 22q11.1. Evidence for linkage across family sets and analyses was most consistent on chromosome 8p21, with a one-LOD support interval that does not include the candidate gene NRG1, suggesting that one or more other susceptibility loci might exist in the region. In this era of genomewide association and deep resequencing studies, consensus linkage regions deserve continued attention, given that linkage signals can be produced by many types of genomic variation, including any combination of multiple common or rare SNPs or copy number variants in a region."}

We attempted to replicate these findings and to conduct a candidate gene and locus evaluation of genetic involvement in common forms of myopia.\nSamples were collected from 517 individuals in 123 families with a myopic child participating in the Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia or the Contact Lens and Myopia Progression Study. Myopia in the proband children was defined as -0.75 D or more and as being present in both meridians on cycloplegic autorefraction (1% tropicamide). Affected status in parents and siblings was determined by survey. After DNA was extracted from buccal mucosal cells and genotyped using assays for microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA was analyzed for linkage disequilibrium. Markers on chromosomes 12 and 18 were selected as regions previously associated with pathological myopia. SNPs were also analyzed in genes where their expression pattern or their association with syndromes conveys myopia as part of the phenotype (FGF2, BDNF, COL2A1, COL18A1, and PAX6).\nThe SNP rs1635529 for COL2A1 on 12q13.11 showed highly significant over-transmission to affected individuals (p=0.00007). No SNP for FGF2, BDNF, COL18A1, or PAX6 showed significant over-transmission to affected individuals after correction for multiple comparisons. Markers on chromosome 12 and 18 previously associated with pathological myopia also showed no significant associations with the more common form of myopia in this study.\nAs reported previously by others, PAX6 showed no association with myopia. Associations in the current analysis are suggestive of involvement of COL2A1. Future studies should focus on replication in other samples and in genome-wide approaches."}

Large rearrangements are less frequent in the BRCA2 gene than in BRCA1. We report, here, the first total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast/ovarian cancer families for BRCA2 large rearrangements. Deletion of exon 3, which is in phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels of alternative transcripts lacking exon 3 (\u03943 delta3 transcript) have been reported in normal tissues, which raises the question whether deletion of exon 3 is pathogenic.\nLarge BRCA2 rearrangements were analysed by QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments) or MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification). The exon 3 deletion was characterized with a \"zoom-in\" dedicated CGH array to the BRCA2 gene and sequencing. To determine the effect of exon 3 deletion and assess its pathogenic effect, three methods of transcript quantification were used: fragment analysis of FAM-labelled PCR products, specific allelic expression using an intron 2 polymorphism and competitive quantitative RT-PCR.\nLarge rearrangements of BRCA2 were detected in six index cases out of 2058 tested (3% of all deleterious BRCA2 mutations). This study reports the first large rearrangement of the BRCA2 gene that includes all of exon 3 and leads to an in frame deletion of exon 3 at the transcriptional level. Thirty five variants in exon 3 and junction regions of BRCA2 are also reported, that contribute to the interpretation of the pathogenicity of the deletion. The quantitative approaches showed that there are three classes of delta3 BRCA2 transcripts (low, moderate and exclusive). Exclusive expression of the delta3 transcript by the mutant allele and segregation data provide evidence for a causal effect of the exon 3 deletion.\nThis paper highlights that large rearrangements and total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene could contribute to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that, to interpret the pathogenic effect of any variants of exon 3, both accurate transcript quantification and co-segregation analysis are required."}

We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites.

As radiotherapy acts through producing DNA damage, we investigated whether genetic variation in DNA repair and damage response confers increased susceptibility to develop late normal skin complications. Breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery were examined for late complications of radiotherapy after a median follow-up time of 51 months. Polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair (APEX1, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, XPD) and damage response (TP53, P21) were determined. Associations between telangiectasia and genotypes were assessed among 409 patients, using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 131 patients presented with telangiectasia and 28 patients with fibrosis. Patients with variant TP53 genotypes either for the Arg72Pro or the PIN3 polymorphism were at increased risk of telangiectasia. The odds ratios (OR) were 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.72) for 72Pro carriers and 1.95 (95% CI: 1.13-3.35) for PIN3 A2 allele carriers compared with non-carriers. The TP53 haplotype containing both variant alleles was associated with almost a two-fold increase in risk (OR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.11-3.52) for telangiectasia. Variants in the TP53 gene may therefore modify the risk of late skin toxicity after radiotherapy."}

Allelotype analysis was done at five short tandem repeat (STR) markers in or adjacent to BRCA1 on the recurrent mutation carriers. For those analyzed both genes, 8.7% of early-onset breast cancer cases and 12.9% of familial breast cancer cases had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, as compared with the 26.1% of cases with both early-onset breast cancer and affected relatives. For those reporting malignancy family history other than breast/ovarian cancer, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutation is about 20.5%, and it was significantly higher than the patients only with family history of breast/ovarian cancer (P = 0.02). The family history of ovarian cancer (26.7% vs. 11.9%) and stomach cancer (23.8% vs. 11.8%) doubled the incidence of BRCA1/2, but the difference did not reach the statistical significance. Two recurrent mutations in BRCA1, 1100delAT and 5589del8, were identified. The recurrent mutations account for 34.8% BRCA1 mutations in our series. Similar allelotypes were detected in most STR status for those harboring the same mutations. The BRCA1 associated tumors were more likely to exhibit a high tumor grade, negative C-erbB-2/neu status and triple negative (ER, PgR and C-erbB-2/neu negative) status (P < 0.05). We recommended the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic analysis could be done for high-risk breast cancer patient in Chinese population, especially for those with both early-onset breast cancer and affected relatives. There may be some degree of shared ancestry for the two recurrent BRCA1 mutations in Chinese."}

We measured mRNA transcripts for five NMDAR subunit mRNAs and protein for the NR1 subunit in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenia and control (n=74) brains. Five NMDAR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with schizophrenia were tested for association with NMDAR mRNAs in postmortem brain and for association with cognitive ability in an antemortem cohort of 101 healthy controls and 48 people with schizophrenia. The NR1 subunit (mRNA and protein) and NR2C mRNA were decreased in postmortem brain from people with schizophrenia (P=0.004, P=0.01 and P=0.01, respectively). In the antemortem cohort, the minor allele of NR2B rs1805502 (T5988C) was associated with significantly lower reasoning ability in schizophrenia. In the postmortem brain, the NR2B rs1805502 (T5988C) C allele was associated with reduced expression of NR1 mRNA and protein in schizophrenia. Reduction in NR1 and NR2C in the DLPFC of people with schizophrenia may lead to altered NMDAR stoichiometry and provides compelling evidence for an endogenous NMDAR deficit in schizophrenia. Genetic variation in the NR2B gene predicts reduced levels of the obligatory NR1 subunit, suggesting a novel mechanism by which the NR2B SNP may negatively influence other NMDAR subunit expression and reasoning ability in schizophrenia."}

Overall, seven loci that associate with plasma CRP at levels achieving genome-wide statistical significance were found (range of p values for lead SNPs within the seven loci: 1.9 x 10(-)(8) to 6.2 x 10(-)(28)). Two of these loci (GCKR and HNF1A) are suspected or known to be associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, one is a gene-desert region on 12q23.2, and the remaining four loci are in or near the leptin receptor protein gene, the apolipoprotein E gene, the interleukin-6 receptor protein gene, or the CRP gene itself. The protein products of six of these seven loci are directly involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, weight homeostasis, and/or premature atherothrombosis.

We perform a transcriptome-scale analysis of genetic variants and miRNA:target interactions identified by CLASH. This analysis reveals that rare variants tend to reside in CDSs, whereas common variants tend to reside in the 3' UTRs. miRNA binding sites are more likely to reside within those targets in the transcriptome with lower variant densities, especially target regions in which nucleotides have low mutation frequencies. Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of genetic variants within or near miRNA binding sites can alter not only the potential of miRNA:target hybridization but also the structural accessibility of the binding sites and flanking regions. These suggest an interpretation for certain associations between genetic variants and diseases, i.e. modulation of miRNA-mediated gene regulation by common or rare variants within or near miRNA binding sites, likely through target structure alterations. Our data will be valuable for discovering new associations among miRNAs, genetic variations and human diseases."}

We also identify six families with ANKS6 mutations affected by nephronophthisis, including severe cardiovascular abnormalities, liver fibrosis and situs inversus. The oxygen sensor HIF1AN hydroxylates ANKS6 and INVS and alters the composition of the ANKS6-INVS-NPHP3 module. Knockdown of Hif1an in Xenopus results in a phenotype that resembles loss of other NPHP proteins.

Mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene were found to underlie both, autosomal recessive cutis laxa type 2 (ARCL2), Debr\u00e9 type, and wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS). The ATP6V0A2 gene encodes the a2 subunit of the V-type H(+)-ATPase, playing a role in proton translocation, and possibly also in membrane fusion. Here, we describe a highly variable phenotype in 13 patients with ARCL2, including the oldest affected individual described so far, who showed strikingly progressive dysmorphic features and heterotopic calcifications. In these individuals we identified 17 ATP6V0A2 mutations, 14 of which are novel. Furthermore, we demonstrate a localization of ATP6V0A2 at the Golgi-apparatus and a loss of the mutated ATP6V0A2 protein in patients' dermal fibroblasts. Investigation of brefeldin A-induced Golgi collapse in dermal fibroblasts as well as in HeLa cells deficient for ATP6V0A2 revealed a delay, which was absent in cells deficient for the ARCL-associated proteins GORAB or PYCR1. Furthermore, fibroblasts from patients with ATP6V0A2 mutations displayed elevated TGF-\u03b2 signalling and increased TGF-\u03b21 levels in the supernatant. Our current findings expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum and suggest that, besides the known glycosylation defect, alterations in trafficking and signalling processes are potential key events in the pathogenesis of ATP6V0A2-related ARCL."}

To test the genetic role of glutamate receptors and their interacting scaffold proteins, the exons of ten glutamatergic 'hub' genes in 1304 individuals were re-sequenced in case and control samples. No significant difference in the overall number of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) was observed between cases and controls. However, cluster analysis of nsSNPs identified two exons encoding the cysteine-rich domain and first transmembrane helix of GRM1 as a risk locus with five mutations highly enriched within these domains. A new splice variant lacking the transmembrane GPCR domain of GRM1 was discovered in the human brain and the GRM1 mutation cluster could perturb the regulation of this variant. The predicted effect on individuals harbouring multiple mutations distributed in their ten hub genes was also examined. Diseased individuals possessed an increased load of deleteriousness from multiple concurrent rare and common coding variants. Together, these data suggest a disease model in which the interplay of compound genetic coding variants, distributed among glutamate receptors and their interacting proteins, contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders."}

The association appeared to be strongest in severely affected patients. In a second step, the study was extended to include an independent sample of 239 triads with dyslexia, in which the association--in particular, with the severe phenotype of dyslexia--was confirmed. Our expression data showed that DCDC2, which contains a doublecortin homology domain that is possibly involved in cortical neuron migration, is expressed in the fetal and adult CNS, which--together with the hypothesized protein function--is in accordance with findings in dyslexic patients with abnormal neuronal migration and maturation."}

Although significant associations with several biological candidate genes on chromosome 10 have been reported, these findings have not been consistently replicated, and they remain controversial. We performed a chromosome 10-specific association study with 1,412 gene-based single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify susceptibility genes for developing LOAD. The scan included SNPs in 677 of 1,270 known or predicted genes; each gene contained one or more markers, about half (48%) of which represented putative functional mutations. In general, the initial testing was performed in a white case-control sample from the St. Louis area, with 419 LOAD cases and 377 age-matched controls. Markers that showed significant association in the exploratory analysis were followed up in several other white case-control sample sets to confirm the initial association. Of the 1,397 markers tested in the exploratory sample, 69 reached significance (P < .05). Five of these markers replicated at P < .05 in the validation sample sets. One marker, rs498055, located in a gene homologous to RPS3A (LOC439999), was significantly associated with Alzheimer disease in four of six case-control series, with an allelic P value of .0001 for a meta-analysis of all six samples. One of the case-control samples with significant association to rs498055 was derived from the linkage sample (P = .0165). These results indicate that variants in the RPS3A homologue are associated with LOAD and implicate this gene, adjacent genes, or other functional variants (e.g., noncoding RNAs) in the pathogenesis of this disorder."}

This may be driven by functional polymorphisms in the genes for cytokines and cytokine receptors involved in the development of osteolysis in THA, thereby having an effect on the individual's phenotype.\nWe performed a study on 22 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 11 cytokines and two cytokine receptor candidate genes for association with severity of acetabular osteolysis and risk to failure in THA. Samples from 205 unrelated Caucasian patients with cementless type THA (ABG 1) were investigated. Distribution of investigated SNP variants between the groups of mild and severe acetabular osteolysis was determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Time-dependent output variables were analyzed by the Cox hazards model.\nUnivariate analysis showed: 1) TNF-238*A allele was associated with severe osteolysis (odds ratio, OR = 6.59, p = 0.005, population attributable risk, PAR 5.2%); 2) carriers of the IL6-174*G allele were 2.5 times more prone to develop severe osteolysis than non-carriers (OR = 2.51, p = 0.007, PAR = 31.5%); 3) the carriage of IL2-330*G allele was associated with protection from severe osteolysis (OR = 0.55, p = 0.043). Based on logistic regression, the alleles TNF-238*A and IL6-174*G were independent predictors for the development of severe acetabular osteolysis. Carriers of TNF-238*A had increased cumulative hazard of THA failure according to Cox model (p = 0.024). In contrast, IL2-330*G allele predicted lower cumulative hazard of THA failure (p = 0.019).\nGenetic variants of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 confer susceptibility to severe OL. In this way, presence of the minor TNF allele could increase the cumulative risk of THA failure. Conversely, SNP in the IL2 gene may protect carriers from the above THA complications."}

We investigated SNPs using 871 patients and 863 controls, following up the top hits in four independent cohorts comprising 1,460 patients and 12,995 controls, all of European origin. We found no genome-wide significant associations, nor could we provide support for any previously reported candidate gene or genome-wide associations. We went on to examine CNVs using a subset of 1,013 cases and 1,084 controls of European ancestry, and a further set of 60 cases and 64 controls of African ancestry. We found that eight cases and zero controls carried deletions greater than 2 Mb, of which two, at 8p22 and 16p13.11-p12.4, are newly reported here. A further evaluation of 1,378 controls identified no deletions greater than 2 Mb, suggesting a high prior probability of disease involvement when such deletions are observed in cases. We also provide further evidence for some smaller, previously reported, schizophrenia-associated CNVs, such as those in NRXN1 and APBA2. We could not provide strong support for the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients have a significantly greater \"load\" of large (>100 kb), rare CNVs, nor could we find common CNVs that associate with schizophrenia. Finally, we did not provide support for the suggestion that schizophrenia-associated CNVs may preferentially disrupt genes in neurodevelopmental pathways. Collectively, these analyses provide the first integrated study of SNPs and CNVs in schizophrenia and support the emerging view that rare deleterious variants may be more important in schizophrenia predisposition than common polymorphisms. While our analyses do not suggest that implicated CNVs impinge on particular key pathways, we do support the contribution of specific genomic regions in schizophrenia, presumably due to recurrent mutation. On balance, these data suggest that very few schizophrenia patients share identical genomic causation, potentially complicating efforts to personalize treatment regimens."}

Whilst severity of disease is influenced by trimester in which infection is acquired by the mother, other factors including genetic predisposition may contribute.\nIn 457 mother-child pairs from Europe, and 149 child/parent trios from North America, we show that ocular and brain disease in congenital toxoplasmosis associate with polymorphisms in ABCA4 encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily A, member 4. Polymorphisms at COL2A1 encoding type II collagen associate only with ocular disease. Both loci showed unusual inheritance patterns for the disease allele when comparing outcomes in heterozygous affected children with outcomes in affected children of heterozygous mothers. Modeling suggested either an effect of mother's genotype, or parent-of-origin effects. Experimental studies showed that both ABCA4 and COL2A1 show isoform-specific epigenetic modifications consistent with imprinting.\nThese associations between clinical outcomes of congenital toxoplasmosis and polymorphisms at ABCA4 and COL2A1 provide novel insight into the molecular pathways that can be affected by congenital infection with this parasite."}

Informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers located throughout the previously defined region were used for haplotype analysis. Four candidate genes within the refined region were screened for biologically significant mutations using direct genomic sequencing: bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2); phospholipase C beta 1 (PLCB1); phospholipase C beta 4 (PLCB4); and BTB POZ domain containing 3 (BTBD3).\nHaplotype analysis identified a new critical interval of 12.7 Mb using a combination of SNPs and microsatellite markers.

We have examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TGFbeta1 gene and the incidence of invasive breast cancer in three case-control series, with a maximum of 3987 patients and 3867 controls, median age approximately 50 years, and range 22-92 years. The promoter SNP, C-509T, and the T +29C signal-peptide SNP (encoding Leu10Pro) are in strong linkage disequilibrium. They are both significantly associated with increased incidence of invasive breast cancer in a recessive manner [odds ratios: (TT versus C-carrier), 1.25; 95% confidence intervals 1.06-1.48; P = 0.009 and (ProPro versus Leu-carrier), 1.21; 95% confidence intervals 1.05-1.37; P = 0.01]. The G-800A SNP was not significantly associated with incidence of breast cancer. The C-509T SNP is not contained within a known consensus sequence for a promoter regulatory element and therefore unlikely to affect TGFbeta1 expression, whereas the Leu10Pro signal peptide substitution potentially affects TGFbeta1 secretion. Transfections of HeLa cells with constructs encoding either the Pro or Leu forms of TGFbeta1 and driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter indicate that the signal peptide with Pro at residue 10 causes a 2.8-fold increase in secretion compared with the Leu form. These data indicate that the allele encoding Pro10 is associated with increased rates of TGFbeta1 secretion and with increased incidence of invasive breast cancer for the population samples described. It is estimated that 3% of all breast cancer cases may be attributable to Pro10 homozygosity."}

We infer recombination sites to the lowest median resolution demonstrated to date (< 1,000 base pairs). We use family inheritance state analysis to control sequencing error and inform family-wide haplotype phasing, allowing quantification of genome-wide compound heterozygosity. We develop a sequence-based methodology for Human Leukocyte Antigen typing that contributes to disease risk prediction.

In single-locus analysis, only genotypes of rs1800469 differed significantly between patients with CAD and controls (P = .001); patients carrying the mutant allele of rs1800469 exhibited a 73% increased risk of CAD (P < .001). Haplotype analysis indicated that haplotype A-T-T-C-C (alleles in the order of rs1800468, rs1800469, rs1800470, rs1800471, and rs1800472) was associated with a 1.49-fold increased risk (P = .003). Interaction analysis identified an overall best 3-locus model including rs1800469, rs1800468, and rs1800471 (P = .003). Taken together, we identified a synergistic interaction between TGFB1 gene multiple polymorphisms that entailed greater risk of CAD in Chinese patients."}

A combination of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations appears responsible for about 20%-30% of the cases with breast cancer familial history. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations largely varies within different populations; in particular, the rate of mutations in Italian breast and/or ovarian cancer families is rather controversial and ranges from 8% to 37%.\nOf the 152 breast/ovarian cancer families counseled in our centre, 99 were selected for BRCA1/2 mutation screening according to our minimal criteria. The entire coding sequences and each intron/exon boundary of BRCA1/2 genes were screened by direct sequencing (PTT limited to BRCA1 exon 11). For each proband, the a priori probability of carrying a pathogenic BRCA1/2 germline mutation was calculated by means of different mutation prediction models (BRCApro, IC and Myriad Table) in order to evaluate their performances.\nOur analysis resulted in the identification of 25 and 52 variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively. Seventeen of them represent novel variants, including four deleterious truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene (472insA, E33X, C1630X and IVS6+1G>C). Twenty-seven of the 99 probands harbored BRCA1 (n = 15) and BRCA2 (n = 12) pathogenic germline mutations, indicating an overall detection rate of 27.3% and increasing by more than 15% the spectrum of mutations in the Italian population. Furthermore, we found the lowest detection rate (19.4%) in pure hereditary breast cancer family subset. All of the prediction models showed praises and faults, with the IC software being extremely sensitive but poorly specific, compared to BRCApro. In particular all models accumulated most false-negative prediction in the HBC subset. Interestingly preliminary results of a study addressing the presence of genomic rearrangements in HBC probands with BRCApro or IC prediction scores >/=95%, provided evidence for additional mutations undetectable with our conventional screening for point mutations.\nAltogether our results suggest that HBC families, the largest pool in our series, represent an heterogeneous group where the apparently faulty performances of the prediction models might be at least partially explained by the presence of additional kinds of BRCA1/2 alteration (such as genomic rearrangements) or by mutations on different breast cancer related genes."}

The sum of rare and common genetic variants robustly identified so far explain only 1%-2% of the population variation in BP and hypertension.

We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,621 hypertensive cases and 1,699 controls and follow-up validation analyses in 19,845 cases and 16,541 controls using an extreme case-control design. We identified a locus on chromosome 16 in the 5' region of Uromodulin (UMOD; rs13333226, combined P value of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9). The minor G allele is associated with a lower risk of hypertension (OR [95%CI]: 0.87 [0.84-0.91]), reduced urinary uromodulin excretion, better renal function; and each copy of the G allele is associated with a 7.7% reduction in risk of CVD events after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and smoking status (H.R.\u200a=\u200a0.923, 95% CI 0.860-0.991; p\u200a=\u200a0.027). In a subset of 13,446 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements, we show that rs13333226 is independently associated with hypertension (unadjusted for eGFR: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p\u200a=\u200a0.004; after eGFR adjustment: 0.89 [0.83-0.96], p\u200a=\u200a0.003). In clinical functional studies, we also consistently show the minor G allele is associated with lower urinary uromodulin excretion. The exclusive expression of uromodulin in the thick portion of the ascending limb of Henle suggests a putative role of this variant in hypertension through an effect on sodium homeostasis. The newly discovered UMOD locus for hypertension has the potential to give new insights into the role of uromodulin in BP regulation and to identify novel drugable targets for reducing cardiovascular risk."}

Careful clinical and molecular characterization of large cohorts of patients affected with inherited eye diseases will be an essential step in the development of effective therapy for these diseases, especially when the therapy involves gene replacement.\nA molecular genetic case-control study.\nSix hundred forty-two unrelated individuals with the clinical diagnosis of LCA and 200 unrelated control individuals were screened for disease-causing sequence variations in eight genes using various combinations of single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), automated DNA sequencing, multiplex allele-specific ligation analysis (SNPlex), and high-density solid-phase single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping.\nFour hundred forty instances of 189 different disease-causing sequence variations were observed in this study, 98 of which have not been previously reported. One hundred forty-six of the 189 variations (77%) were observed in only a single individual. The observed variations were not evenly distributed among the LCA patients or among the eight genes. Empirical analysis of this uneven distribution was used to devise a multi-platform mutation detection strategy that is four times more efficient than a more conventional strategy of completely sequencing all of the coding regions of all LCA genes in all subjects. Hardy-Weinberg analysis of the observed mutations suggests that these eight genes are collectively responsible for about 70% of the cases of LCA in North America. The carrier frequency of the most common LCA allele (an intron 26 variation in CEP290) was found to be 2/3,248, which suggests that the overall prevalence of LCA in this population is about 1/81,000. An allele-specific ligation assay (SNPlex) was designed to detect 68 of the most common LCA-causing alleles, and semi-quantitative analysis of the data from this assay also revealed examples of gene deletion and isodisomy in the cohort.\nThe data demonstrates that a tiered screening strategy combining allele-specific detection with automated DNA sequencing can increase the efficiency of autosomal recessive mutation detection four-fold when compared with DNA sequencing alone. However, the very high rate of unique mutations observed in this study (77%) suggests that DNA sequencing will remain an important part of the overall strategy if high sensitivity is to be achieved."}

This study aimed at investigating the association between schizophrenia susceptibility and selected functional polymorphisms in genes encoding cytokines including: interleukin-2 (IL2 -330T>G, rs2069756), interleukin-6 (IL-6 -174G>C, rs1800795), interferon-\u03b3 (IFNG +874T>A, rs2430561) as well as for the first time transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGFB1 +869T>C, rs1800470 and +916G>C, rs1800471).

There was a significant difference in the genotype distribution and allelic frequency of the TGFB1 +869T>C between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls (p < 0.05). The risk of schizophrenia was more than two-fold higher in carriers of T allele (CT+TT genotypes) than individuals with CC genotype. Given documented gender differences in incidence of schizophrenia, we conducted separate analyses of male and female participants. We have shown that the association was significant in females, while in males it reached a trend toward statistical significance.

In the present study, the role of variations in GRIN2B, which encodes the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, was explored with regard to the regulation of arousal and attention by comparing the efficiency of the three attentional networks as measured with the Attention Network Test (ANT). Two synonymous SNPs in GRIN2B, rs1806201 (T888T) and rs1806191 (H1178H) were genotyped in 324 young Caucasian adults. Results revealed a highly specific modulatory influence of SNP rs1806201 on alerting processes with subjects homozygous for the frequent C allele displaying higher alerting network scores as compared to the other two genotype groups (CT and TT). This effect is due to the fact that in the no cue condition faster reaction times were evident in participants carrying at least one of the rare T alleles, possibly as a result of more effective glutamatergic neurotransmission. The results might be further explained by a dissociation between tonic and phasic alertness modulated by the GRIN2B genotype and by a ceiling effect, meaning that subjects cannot be phasicly alert in excess to a certain level. Altogether, the results show that variations in GRIN2B have to be taken into consideration when examining attentional processes."}

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and allele frequencies in this region are highly differentiated across broad geographical populations, making it a region of interest for population genetics and immunity-related disease studies. We examined LD in this important region of the genome in six European populations using 166 putatively neutral SNPs and the classical HLA-A, -B and -C gene alleles. We found that the pattern of association between classic HLA gene alleles and SNPs implied that most of the SNPs predated the origin of classic HLA gene alleles. The SNPs most strongly associated with HLA gene alleles were in some cases highly predictive of the HLA allele carrier status (misclassification rates ranged from <1 to 27%) in independent populations using five or fewer SNPs, a much smaller number than tagSNP panels previously proposed and often with similar accuracy, showing that our approach may be a viable solution to designing new HLA prediction panels. To describe the LD within this region, we developed a new haplotype clustering method/software based on r(2), which may be more appropriate for use within regions of strong LD. Haplotype blocks created using this proposed method, as well as classic HLA gene alleles and SNPs, were predictive of a northern versus southern European population membership (misclassification error rates ranged from 0 to 23%, depending on which independent population was used for prediction), indicating that this region may be a rich source of ancestry informative markers."}

Drosophila Zmynd10 with an equivalent c.47T>G (p.Val16Gly) missense change rescued mutant male sterility less than the wild-type did. Tagged Drosophila ZMYND10 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm, and human ZMYND10 interacts with LRRC6, another cytoplasmically localized protein altered in PCD. Using a fly model of PCD, we conclude that ZMYND10 is a cytoplasmic protein required for IDA and ODA assembly and that its variants cause ciliary dysmotility and PCD with laterality defects."}

The collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) gene is a prominent candidate gene for osteoporosis. Here, we examined whether genetic variants at the COL1A1 gene can influence BMD variation.\nBMD was measured at nine skeletal sites in 313 Caucasian males and 308 Caucasian females. We screened four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the COL1A1 gene: PCOL2 (-1997 G/T) in the promoter, Sp1 (1546 G/T) in the intron 1, Gly19Cys (3911 G/A) in exon 8, and Ala897Thr (13 773 G/A) in exon 45. Univariate and multivariate association approaches were used in the analyses.\nIn multivariate analyses, we found a strong association between the PCOL2 SNP and BMD (p = 0.007 to 0.024) and a suggestive association between the Sp1 SNP and BMD (p = 0.023 to 0.048) in elderly Caucasian females. Interestingly, the interaction of these two SNPs was highly significantly associated with BMD variation (p = 0.001 to 0.003). The haplotype GG at the two SNPs had, on average, 2.7% higher BMD than non-carriers (p = 0.006 to 0.026).\nOur data suggested that the common genetic variants at the PCOL2 and Sp1 sites, and importantly, their interactive effects, may contribute to BMD variation in elderly Caucasian females. Further studies are necessary to delineate the mechanisms underlying the effects of these common variants on BMD variation and to test their clinical relevance for general populations. In addition, our study highlighted the importance of multivariate analyses when multiple correlated phenotypes are under study."}

This theme offers the possibility that the GRIN2B gene, encoding this selective NR2B subunit, represents a potential molecular modulating factor for this disease. Based on this hypothesis, we carried out a mutation scanning of exons and flanking regions of GRIN2B in a well-characterized cohort of AD patients, recruited from Southern Italy. A \"de novo\" p.K1293R mutation, affecting a highly conserved residue of the protein in the C-terminal domain, was observed for the first time in a woman with familial AD, as the only genetic alteration of relevance. Moreover, an association study between the other detected sequence variants and AD was performed. In particular, the study was focused on five identified single nucleotide polymorphisms: rs7301328, rs1805482, rs3026160, rs1806191 and rs1806201, highlighting a significant contribution from the GRIN2B rs1806201 T allele towards disease susceptibility [adjusted odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40-2.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, after correction for sex, age, and APOE \u03b54 genotype].

Although the pathogenic role of the GRIN2B-K1293R mutation in AD is not clear, our data advocate that genetic variability in the GRIN2B gene, involved in synaptic functioning, might provide valuable insights into disease pathogenesis, continuing to attract significant attention in biomedical research on its genetic and functional role."}

Additionally, rare mutations in several other genes that interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of HBC. Still, a majority of HBC cases remain unexplained which is challenging for genetic counseling. We aimed to analyze additional mutations in HBC-associated genes and to define the sensitivity of our current BRCA1/2 mutation analysis protocol used in genetic counseling.\nEighty-two well-characterized, high-risk hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals, were screened for germline alterations in seven breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, RAD50, and CDH1. BRCA1/2 were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing. CHEK2 was analyzed by the high resolution melt (HRM) method and PALB2, RAD50, BRIP1 and CDH1 were analyzed by direct sequencing. Carrier frequencies between 82 (HBOC) BRCA1/2-founder mutation-negative Finnish individuals and 384 healthy Finnish population controls were compared by using Fisher's exact test. In silico prediction for novel missense variants effects was carried out by using Pathogenic-Or-Not -Pipeline (PON-P).\nThree previously reported breast cancer-associated variants, BRCA1 c.5095C > T, CHEK2 c.470T > C, and CHEK2 c.1100delC, were observed in eleven (13.4%) individuals. Ten of these individuals (12.2%) had CHEK2 variants, c.470T > C and/or c.1100delC. Fourteen novel sequence alterations and nine individuals with more than one non-synonymous variant were identified. One of the novel variants, BRCA2 c.72A > T (Leu24Phe) was predicted to be likely pathogenic in silico. No large genomic rearrangements were detected in BRCA1/2 by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).\nIn this study, mutations in previously known breast cancer susceptibility genes can explain 13.4% of the analyzed high-risk BRCA1/2-negative HBOC individuals. CHEK2 mutations, c.470T > C and c.1100delC, make a considerable contribution (12.2%) to these high-risk individuals but further segregation analysis is needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these mutations before applying them in clinical use. Additionally, we identified novel variants that warrant additional studies. Our current genetic testing protocol for 28 Finnish BRCA1/2-founder mutations and protein truncation test (PTT) of the largest exons is sensitive enough for clinical use as a primary screening tool."}

We report the results of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on age-independent and age-dependent TMT performance in two population-representative community samples (Munich Antidepressant Response Signature, MARS: N1 = 540; Ludwig Maximilians University, LMU: N2 = 350). Age-dependent genome-wide findings were then evaluated in a third sample of healthy elderly subjects (Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, Sydney MAS: N3 = 448). While a meta-analysis on the GWAS findings did not reveal age-independent TMT associations withstanding correction for multiple testing, we found a genome-wide significant age-moderated effect between variants in the DSG1 gene region and TMT-A performance predominantly reflecting visual processing speed (rs2199301, P(meta-analysis) = 1.3 \u00d7 10(-7)). The direction of the interaction suggests for the minor allele a beneficial effect in younger adults turning into a detrimental effect in older adults. The detrimental effect of the missense single nucleotide polymorphism rs1426310 within the same DSG1 gene region could be replicated in Sydney MAS participants aged 70-79, but not in those aged 80 years and older, presumably a result of survivor bias. Our findings demonstrate opposing effects of DSG1 variants on information processing speed depending on age, which might be related to the complex processes that DSG1 is involved with, including cell adhesion and apoptosis."}

Several polymorphisms have been identified in TGFB1, and previous work has suggested that allelic variants of TGFB1 may regulate BMD and susceptibility to osteoporotic fracture.\nWe studied the relationship between common polymorphisms of TGFB1 and several osteoporosis-related phenotypes including BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, measured by DXA; bone loss over a 6-year period; biochemical markers of bone turnover (urinary free deoxypyridinoline and free pyridinoline/creatinine ratio and serum N-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen), and fractures in a population-based study of 2975 women from the United Kingdom.

Urine and plasma samples were collected from two cohorts of individuals of European descent, with one cohort comprised of female twins donating samples longitudinally. Sample metabolite concentrations were quantified by (1)H NMR and tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Four metabolites' concentrations exhibited significant, replicable association with SNP variation (8.6\u00d710(-11)<p<2.8\u00d710(-23)). Three of these-trimethylamine, 3-amino-isobutyrate, and an N-acetylated compound-were measured in urine. The other-dimethylamine-was measured in plasma. Trimethylamine and dimethylamine mapped to a single genetic region (hence we report a total of three implicated genomic regions). Two of the three hit regions lie within haplotype blocks (at 2p13.1 and 10q24.2) that carry the genetic signature of strong, recent, positive selection in European populations. Genes NAT8 and PYROXD2, both with relatively uncharacterized functional roles, are good candidates for mediating the corresponding mQTL associations. The study's longitudinal twin design allowed detailed variance-components analysis of the sources of population variation in metabolite levels. The mQTLs explained 40%-64% of biological population variation in the corresponding metabolites' concentrations. These effect sizes are stronger than those reported in a recent, targeted mQTL study of metabolites in serum using the targeted-metabolomics Biocrates platform. By re-analysing our plasma samples using the Biocrates platform, we replicated the mQTL findings of the previous study and discovered a previously uncharacterized yet substantial familial component of variation in metabolite levels in addition to the heritability contribution from the corresponding mQTL effects."}

However, studies suggest a weak relationship between LTG plasma concentration and increase in RMT. This undermines the possibility to use the technique to investigate the dose-efficacy relationship of lamotrigine or novel sodium channel blocking drugs. In order to investigate this relationship further, we have examined blood and brain concentrations of LTG in parallel with the drugs effects on RMT in a model in which electrical-stimulation is used to activate the motor cortex of propofol-anaesthetised rats. LTG (3-20 mg/kg s.c.) significantly increased RMT (P<0.001). There was a significant (P<0.01) positive correlation between LTG blood and brain concentration and increase in RMT; however correlation-coefficients were low (brain: r(2)=0.26 and blood r(2)=0.25), with evidence for non-responders, similar to human studies. The results show that the variation in RMT response is unlikely to be due to pharmacokinetic differences between subjects, and suggest that biological differences may underpin the variability. Understanding the source of this variability will be an important goal and, assuming some relationship between the effects of LTG on motor pathway excitability and the drugs anticonvulsant efficacy, could lead to a means to identify epilepsy patients that may be more likely to respond to treatment."}

This question has important implications for health policy and the design of epidemiologic studies. To establish the relative contributions of founder and nonfounder BRCA mutations, we established the entire spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a large set of breast-ovarian cancer families with origins in all regions of Poland. We sequenced the entire coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 100 Polish families with 3 or more cases of breast cancer and in 100 families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancer. A mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was detected in 66% of breast cancer families and in 63% of breast-ovarian cancer families. Of 129 mutations, 122 (94.6%) were in BRCA1 and 7 (5.4%) were in BRCA2. Of the 122 families with BRCA1 mutations, 119 (97.5%) had a recurrent mutation (i.e., one that was seen in at least 2 families). In particular, 111 families (91.0%) carried one of the 3 common founder mutations. The mutation spectrum was not different between families with and without ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that a rapid and inexpensive assay directed at identifying the 3 common founder mutations will have a sensitivity of 86% compared to a much more costly and labor-intensive full-sequence analysis of both genes. This rapid test will facilitate large-scale national epidemiologic and clinical studies of hereditary breast cancer, potentially including studies of chemoprevention."}

Genomic DNA samples were screened for known variants in the AIPL1 gene using a microarray LCA chip, with 153 of these cases then being directly sequenced.

The chip identified AIPL1 variants in 12 patients. Sequencing of AIPL1 in 153 patients and 96 controls found a total of 46 variants, with 29 being novel. In silico analysis suggested that only 6 of these variants are likely to be disease-causing, indicating a previously unrecognized high degree of polymorphism. Seven patients were identified with biallelic changes in AIPL1 likely to be disease-causing. In the youngest subject, electroretinography revealed reduced cone photoreceptor function, but rod responses were within normal limits, with no measurable ERG in other patients. An increasing degree and extent of peripheral retinal pigmentation and degree of maculopathy was noted with increasing age in our series. AIPL1 is significantly polymorphic in both controls and patients, thereby complicating the establishment of disease-causation of identified variants. Despite the associated phenotype being characterised by early-onset severe visual loss in our patient series, there was some evidence of a degree of retinal structural and functional preservation, which was most marked in the youngest patient in our cohort. This data suggests that there are patients who have a reasonable window of opportunity for gene therapy in childhood."}

We identified six novel missense mutations and one novel deletion leading to a premature stop codon in ALOX12B in only six out of the 11 families which led us to investigate a possible implication of ALOX15B. Mutation analysis of this gene, as well as ALOXE3, which is known to be mutated in some cases of ARCI, failed to reveal causative mutations in the five remaining ARCI families, indicating that other genes on chromosome 17p13 may be involved in this disease.

Therefore, GPCR variants may have conferred important selective advantages during periods of human evolution. Indeed, several genomic loci with signatures of recent selection in humans contain GPCR genes among them the X-chromosomally located gene for GPR82. This gene encodes a so-called orphan GPCR with unknown function. To address the functional relevance of GPR82 gene-deficient mice were characterized. GPR82-deficient mice were viable, reproduced normally, and showed no gross anatomical abnormalities. However, GPR82-deficient mice have a reduced body weight and body fat content associated with a lower food intake. Moreover, GPR82-deficient mice showed decreased serum triacylglyceride levels, increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, most pronounced under Western diet. Because there were no differences in respiratory and metabolic rates between wild-type and GPR82-deficient mice our data suggest that GPR82 function influences food intake and, therefore, energy and body weight balance. GPR82 may represent a thrifty gene most probably representing an advantage during human expansion into new environments."}

This study sought to characterize the functional effects of this polymorphism on alternative splicing of SCN1A and to explore the potential for modulating the drug response in the pharmacologically unfavorable genotype by identification of a splice modifier acting on SCN1A. The effects of the genotype at the SCN1A IVS5N+5 G-->A polymorphism on SCN1A splice-variant proportions and the consequences of increased expression of splice modifiers were investigated both in human temporal neocortex tissue and in a cellular minigene expression system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the amounts of SCN1A transcripts forms. We show that the polymorphism has a dramatic effect on the proportions of neonate and adult alternative transcripts of SCN1A in adult brain tissue and that the effect of the polymorphism also appears to be modified by Nova2 expression levels. A minigene expression system confirms both the effect of the polymorphism on transcript proportions and the role of Nova2 in the regulation of splicing, with higher Nova2 expression increasing the proportion of the neonate form. A larger Nova2-mediated effect was detected in the AA genotype that is associated with increased dose requirements. The effects of Nova2 on modulation of the alternative splicing of 17 other neuronally expressed genes were investigated, and no effect was observed. These findings emphasize the emerging role of genetic polymorphisms in modulation of drug effect and illustrate both alternative splicing as a potential therapeutic target and the importance of considering the activity of compounds at alternative splice forms of drug targets in screening programs."}

All these VUSs were analyzed by using six tools (splice site prediction by neural network, splice site finder (SSF), MaxEntScan (MES), ESE finder, relative enhancer and silencer classification by unanimous enrichment, and human splicing finder) and the predictions obtained were compared with transcript analysis results. Combining MES and SSF gave 96% sensitivity and 83% specificity for VUSs occurring in the vicinity of consensus splice sites, that is, the surrounding 11 and 14 bases for the 5' and 3' sites, respectively. This study was also an opportunity to define guidelines for transcript analysis along with a tentative classification of splice variants. The guidelines drawn from this large series should be useful for the whole community, particularly in the context of growing sequencing capacities that require robust pipelines for variant interpretation."}

In this study we screened for additional CPA6 mutations in patients with febrile seizures and focal epilepsy, which encompasses the temporal lobe epilepsy subtype. Mutations found from this analysis as well as CPA6 mutations reported in databases of single nucleotide polymorphisms were further screened by analysis of the modeled proCPA6 protein structure and the functional role of the mutated amino acid. The point mutations predicted to affect activity and/or protein folding were tested by expression of the mutant in HEK293 cells and analysis of the resulting CPA6 protein. Common polymorphisms in CPA6 were also included in this analysis. Several mutations resulted in reduced enzyme activity or CPA6 protein levels in the extracellular matrix. The mutants with reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels showed normal levels of 50-kDa proCPA6 in the cell, and this could be converted into 37-kDa CPA6 by trypsin, suggesting that protein folding was not greatly affected by the mutations. Interestingly, three of the mutations that reduced extracellular CPA6 protein levels were found in patients with epilepsy. Taken together, these results provide further evidence for the involvement of CPA6 mutations in human epilepsy and reveal additional rare mutations that inactivate CPA6 and could, therefore, also be associated with epileptic phenotypes."}

To ascertain the role of human host immunogenetics on the lack of circulating Mf in the blood, 152 lymphatic filariasis (LF)-infected patients comprising 118 patients with microfilaremic (Mf+, patent) infection and 34 patients with latent (Mf-, antigen-positive) infection were recruited and genotyped for association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of TGF-\u03b21 and differential Mf load and/or lack of Mf in the blood from infected persons in Ghana. An association was found between the TGF-\u03b21 Leu10Pro variant and lack of Mf in the blood. Patients with latent infection had a higher frequency of the Leu/Leu genotype than patients with patent infection (p = 0.03). Secondary analysis revealed an association among the three possible Leu10Pro genotypes and different Mf loads in the blood. In conclusion, the differential Mf loads and the lack of Mf in the blood of patients is likely to have a genetic basis. Because the adult worms are responsible for pathology, these results underscore the need for a review of using only Mf detection in blood smears for diagnosis of LF infection in endemic areas. This information is also important for the mapping and surveillance activities of national and global programs for elimination of LF."}

Data regarding finger joint pain and other risk factors were collected using a questionnaire. We defined two hand OA phenotypes: radiographic OA in at least three joints (ROA) and symptomatic DIP OA. The genotypes were determined by PCR-based methods. In statistical analysis, we used SNPStats software, the chi-square test and logistic regression.\nOf the SNPs, rs716508 in A2BP1 was associated with ROA (OR\u200a=\u200a0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9) and rs1800470 in TGFB1 with symptomatic DIP OA (1.8, 1.2-2.9). We found an interaction between ESR1 (rs9340799) and occupation: teachers with the minor allele were at an increased risk of symptomatic DIP OA (2.8, 1.3-6.5). We saw no association among the dentists.

The whole region seems related to the cellular response to external damaging agents and markers in it are associated with risk of several cancers.\nWe downloaded the genotypes of all markers typed in the 19q13.3 region in the HapMap populations of European, Asian and African descent and inferred haplotypes. We combined the European HapMap individuals with a Danish breast cancer case-control data set and inferred the association between HapMap haplotypes and disease risk.\nWe found that the susceptibility haplotype in our European sample had increased from 2 to 50 percent very recently in the European population, and to almost the same extent in the Asian population. The cause of this increase is unknown. The maximal proportion of overall genetic variation due to differences between groups for Europeans versus Africans and Europeans versus Asians (the Fst value) closely matched the putative location of the susceptibility variant as judged from haplotype-based association mapping.\nThe combined observation that a common haplotype causing an increased risk of cancer in Europeans and a high differentiation between human populations is highly unusual and suggests a causal relationship with a recent increase in Europeans caused either by genetic drift overruling selection against the susceptibility variant or a positive selection for the same haplotype. The data does not allow us to distinguish between these two scenarios. The analysis suggests that the region is not involved in cancer risk in Africans and that the susceptibility variants may be more finely mapped in Asian populations."}

We used a combined approach consisting of five in silico splicing prediction programs and RT-PCR analysis for a set of 26 variants not previously studied at the mRNA level and six variants that had already been studied, four of which were used as positive controls as they were found to affect the splicing of these genes and the other two were used as negative controls.

No significant results were found. Second, we performed association mapping across a 19.2-Mb region centered under the AAO linkage peak. An iterative association mapping approach was done by initially genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms at an average distance of 100 kb apart and then by increasing the density of markers as needed. Using the overall data set of 267 multiplex families, we identified six associated genes in the region, but further screening of a subset of 83 families linked to the chromosome 1 locus identified only two genes significantly associated with AAO in PD: the gamma subunit of the translation initiation factor EIF2B gene (EIF2B3), which was more significant in the linked subset and the ubiquitin-specific protease 24 gene (USP24). Unexpectedly, the human immunodeficiency virus enhancer-binding protein 3 gene (HIVEP3) was found to be associated with risk for susceptibility to PD. We used several criteria to define significant results in the presence of multiple testing, including criteria derived from a novel cluster approach. The known or putative functions of these genes fit well with the current suspected pathogenic mechanisms of PD and thus show great potential as candidates for the PARK10 locus."}

Although pharmacogenetics is currently the subject of intensive research in several disease domains, it remains relatively unexplored in the field of epilepsy. Drug treatment of epilepsy is characterized by unpredictability of efficacy, adverse drug reactions and optimal doses in individual patients. Moreover, a substantial fraction of patients develop drug refractory epilepsy despite optimal treatment. Insights in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and the mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have improved our understanding of the genetic determinants of AED response. The first reports in epilepsy pharmacogenetics are becoming available, and large-scale pharmacogenetic studies are now possible thanks to recent advances in genetics and decreasing genotyping costs. It is hoped that ultimately, findings in epilepsy pharmacogenetics will lead to a more efficacious and less harmful treatment of epilepsy, development of more effective AEDs and facilitation of clinical trials of new AEDs. However, although pharmacogenetics will undoubtedly improve our insight into the mechanisms underlying response to AEDs and perhaps into the pathogenesis of drug refractory epilepsy, clinical application of any findings is expected to be a long process, and considerable practical and theoretical hurdles need to be overcome before pharmacogenetic information will prove of any major utility in the clinical setting. This review addresses current knowledge on genetic factors contributing to AED response and discusses the potential of epilepsy pharmacogenetics in the clinical treatment of epilepsy and new AED development."}

Relevant studies were screened for quality according to guidelines as proposed by the Dutch Cochrane Centre and evidence was summarized.\nSeventy studies were included in this review. Due to a large heterogeneity in study population, design and outcome measures a formal meta-analysis was not possible. Six of the highest ranked studies (mean n = 2,000) showed that individuals with prevalent subclinical CV disease had higher risk for increased bone loss and fractures during follow-up compared to persons without CV disease (range of reported risk: hazard ratio (HR) 1.5; odds ratio (OR) 2.3 to 3.0). The largest study (n = 31,936) reported a more than four times higher risk in women and more than six times higher risk in men. There is moderate evidence that individuals with low bone mass had higher CV mortality rates and incident CV events than subjects with normal bone mass (risk rates 1.2 to 1.4). Although the shared common pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully elucidated, the most important factors that might explain this association appear to be, besides age, estrogen deficiency and inflammation.\nThe current evidence indicates that individuals with prevalent subclinical CV disease are at increased risk for bone loss and subsequent fractures. Presently no firm conclusions can be drawn as to what extent low bone mineral density might be associated with increased cardiovascular risk."}

In this study, we used a two-stage genotyping approach to identify genes in the linked region that contributed to the variation of femoral neck and lumbar spine areal BMD. In the first stage, 654 SNPs across the linked region were genotyped in a sample of 1309 premenopausal white women. The most significant evidence of association for lumbar spine (p = 1.3 x 10(-6)) was found with rs1127091 in the GATAD2B gene. In the second stage, 52 SNPs around this candidate gene were genotyped in an expanded sample of 1692 white women. Significant evidence of association with spinal BMD (p < 10(-5)), and to a lesser extent with femoral neck BMD, was observed with eight SNPs within a single 230-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. The most significant SNP (p = 3.4 x 10(-7)) accounted for >2.5% of the variation in spinal BMD in these women. The 230-kb LD block contains 11 genes, but because of the extensive LD, the specific gene(s) contributing to the variation in BMD could not be determined. In conclusion, the significant association between spinal BMD and SNPs in the 230-kb LD block in chromosome 1q indicates that genetic factor(s) in this block plays an important role in peak spinal BMD in healthy premenopausal white women."}

A combination of in vivo assays with subsequent in vitro validation suggests that a significant fraction of BBS-associated mutations have a dominant-negative mode of action.

Average BMD in women with the TT genotype was approximately 10% higher at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck compared with women with the CC genotype (spine: 980 vs. 887 mg/cm2, P = 0.05; femoral neck: 755 vs. 674 mg/cm2; P = 0.02). Women with the TT genotype also experienced less overall bone loss at the total hip, compared with women with the CC genotype. Serum levels of TGF-beta1 were higher in women with the TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype (46.5 ng/ml vs. 32.3 ng/ml, P = 0.001). These data are clearly in contrast to findings in postmenopausal Japanese women where the CC genotype was associated with higher BMD and decreased bone loss. Further studies are therefore necessary to clarify the relationship between this polymorphism and BMD."}

Patients of the family presented with bone spicule-shaped pigment deposits in retina, retinal vascular attenuation, retinal and choroidal dystrophy, as well as punctate opacity of the lens, reduced cornea thickness and high myopia. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from all patients and their family members for genetic analysis. After mutation analysis in a few known RP candidate genes, exome sequencing was used to analyze the exomes of 3 patients III2, III4, III6 and the unaffected mother II2. A total of 34,693 variations shared by 3 patients were subjected to several filtering steps against existing variation databases. Identified variations were verified in the rest family members by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Compound heterozygous c.802-8_810del17insGC and c.1091-2A>G mutations of the CYP4V2 gene, known as genetic defects for Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy, were identified as causative mutations for RP of this family."}

We analysed markers, previously reported to be associated with dyslexia, located within the MRPL19/C2ORF3, KIAA0319, DCDC2 and DYX1C1 genes in a sample of 520 individuals and tested them for association with reading and spelling measures. Association signals were detected for several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DYX1C1 with both the reading and spelling tests. The high linkage disequilibrium (LD) we observed across the DYX1C1 gene suggests that the association signal might not be refined by further genetic mapping."}

The aim of this study was to investigate which of these genes is responsible for susceptibility in Chinese patients. A total of 41\u00a0probands with STGD or suspected STGD were enrolled in the study. The coding regions and adjacent intronic sequences of the ELOVL4 and PRPH2 genes and 3 coding exons of the ABCA4 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The nucleotide sequences of the amplicons were determined by Sanger sequencing. Three novel heterozygous missense mutations in the ABCA4 gene were identified: c:2633C>A (p:Ser878X), c:5646G>A (p:Met1882Ile) and c:6389T>A (p:Met2130Lys). These mutations were not present in 176 normal individuals and were predicted to be pathogenic. Two benign variations were found: a reported variation, c:5682G>C in ABCA4 and a novel variation, c:699G>A in ELOVL4. In addition, 5\u00a0single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs3812153, rs7764439, rs390659, rs434102 and c:929G>A) were detected in ELOVL4 and PRPH2. The c:929G>A variation has not been previously reported. We conclude that no pathogenic variations in ELOVL4 and PRPH2 were detected in the Chinese STGD patients.

For replication, we genotyped another 609 family trios, 2322 case subjects, and 789 control subjects and used genotyping data from two external control data sets. A joint analysis of data from 12,360 subjects was performed to estimate the overall significance and effect size of associations between alleles and the risk of multiple sclerosis.\nA transmission disequilibrium test of 334,923 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 931 family trios revealed 49 SNPs having an association with multiple sclerosis (P<1x10(-4)); of these SNPs, 38 were selected for the second-stage analysis. A comparison between the 931 case subjects from the family trios and 2431 control subjects identified an additional nonoverlapping 32 SNPs (P<0.001). An additional 40 SNPs with less stringent P values (<0.01) were also selected, for a total of 110 SNPs for the second-stage analysis. Of these SNPs, two within the interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene (IL2RA) were strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (P=2.96x10(-8)), as were a nonsynonymous SNP in the interleukin-7 receptor alpha gene (IL7RA) (P=2.94x10(-7)) and multiple SNPs in the HLA-DRA locus (P=8.94x10(-81)).\nAlleles of IL2RA and IL7RA and those in the HLA locus are identified as heritable risk factors for multiple sclerosis."}

Segregation of the identified variants was confirmed with Sanger sequencing.\nRetinitis pigmentosa, obesity, and learning difficulties were present in the affected individuals in both families. In family A, a sixth finger (polydactyly) of the proband's sister was removed by a surgical operation leaving a scar on the little finger. Polydactyly was also present in both affected individuals from family B. All diagnostic symptoms were characteristic of BBS in both families. In both affected individuals from family A, exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.47+1G>T) in BBS1 that inactivates the splice donor site at the end of exon 1. In family B, a previously reported mutation, c.442G>A; p.(Asp148Asn), was detected.\nExome sequencing is an efficient and cost-effective technique for identifying mutations in genetically heterogeneous diseases.

However, each GWA locus typically comprises a set of contiguous genes, only one of which presumably modulates height. We reasoned that many of the causative genes within these loci influence height because they are expressed in and function in the growth plate, a cartilaginous structure that causes bone elongation and thus determines stature. Therefore, we used expression microarray studies of mouse and rat growth plate, human disease databases and a mouse knockout phenotype database to identify genes within the GWAS loci that are likely required for normal growth plate function. Each of these approaches identified significantly more genes within the GWA height loci than at random genomic locations (P < 0.0001 each), supporting the validity of the approach. The combined analysis strongly implicates 78 genes in growth plate function, including multiple genes that participate in PTHrP-IHH, BMP and CNP signaling, and many genes that have not previously been implicated in the growth plate. Thus, this analysis reveals a large number of novel genes that regulate human growth plate chondrogenesis and thereby contribute to the normal variations in human adult height. The analytic approach developed for this study may be applied to GWA studies for other common polygenic traits and diseases, thus providing a new general strategy to identify causative genes within GWA loci and to translate genetic associations into mechanistic biological insights."}

Although OI generally results from mutations in the type I collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, the relationship between genotype and phenotype is not yet well understood. To provide additional data for genotype-phenotype analyses and to determine the proportion of mutations in the type I collagen genes among subjects with lethal forms of OI, we sequenced the coding and exon-flanking regions of COL1A1 and COL1A2 in a cohort of 63 subjects with OI type II, the perinatal lethal form of the disease. We identified 61 distinct heterozygous mutations in type I collagen, including five non-synonymous rare variants of unknown significance, of which 43 had not been seen previously. In addition, we found 60 SNPs in COL1A1, of which 17 were not reported previously, and 82 in COL1A2, of which 18 are novel. In three samples without collagen mutations, we found inactivating mutations in CRTAP and LEPRE1, suggesting a frequency of these recessive mutations of approximately 5% in OI type II. A computational model that predicts the outcome of substitutions for glycine within the triple helical domain of collagen alpha1(I) chains predicted lethality with approximately 90% accuracy. The results contribute to the understanding of the etiology of OI by providing data to evaluate and refine current models relating genotype to phenotype and by providing an unbiased indication of the relative frequency of mutations in OI-associated genes."}

Whether MMPs and TIMPs participate in the pathogenesis of AMD and PCV remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between circulating MMP and TIMP levels and AMD and PCV.\nThe serum levels of MMPs (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9) and TIMPs (TIMP1 and TIMP3) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in four groups of subjects (n=342): early AMD (group 1, n=75), neovascular AMD (group 2, n=89), PCV (group 3, n=98), and age- and gender-matched controls (group 4, n=80).\nThe mean concentrations of the two gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9, in the PCV group were significantly higher than that of the control (p=0.001, p<0.001, respectively), early AMD (both p<0.001), and neovascular AMD (p=0.005, p=0.001, respectively) groups. Moreover, the serum MMP2 concentration was positively correlated with the serum MMP9 concentration in the PCV group (r=0.822, p<0.001). However, the mean concentrations of MMP2 and MMP9 in the early AMD and neovascular AMD groups were not significantly different from that of the control group (p>0.05). The mean serum levels of MMP1, MMP3, TIMP1, and TIMP3 were not significantly different among the four groups.\nThis pilot study first reveals a link between increased levels of circulating gelatinases (MMP2 and MMP9) and PCV but not AMD, which may provide a biologically relevant marker of ECM metabolism in patients with PCV.

To dissect the genetic risk factors of PTB a large-scale high-throughput candidate gene association study was performed examining 1536 SNP in 130 candidate genes from hypothesized PTB pathways. Maternal and fetal DNA from 370 US Caucasian birth-events (172 cases and 198 controls) was examined. Single locus, haplotype, and multi-locus association analyses were performed separately on maternal and fetal data. For maternal data the strongest associations were found in genes in the complement-coagulation pathway related to decidual hemorrhage in PTB. In this pathway 3 of 6 genes examined had SNPs significantly associated with PTB. These include factor V (FV) that was previously associated with PTB, factor VII (FVII), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The single strongest effect was observed in tPA marker rs879293 with a significant allelic (p = 2.30x10(-3)) and genotypic association (p = 2.0x10(-6)) with PTB. The odds ratio (OR) for this SNP was 2.80 [CI 1.77-4.44] for a recessive model. Given that 6 of 8 markers in tPA were statistically significant, sliding window haplotype analyses were performed and revealed an associating 4 marker haplotype in tPA (p = 6.00x10(-3)). The single strongest effect in fetal DNA was observed in the inflammatory pathway at rs17121510 in the interleukin-10 receptor antagonist (IL-10RA) gene for allele (p = 0.01) and genotype (p = 3.34x10(-4)). The OR for the IL-10RA genotypic additive model was 1.92 [CI 1.15-3.19] (p = 2.00x10(-3)). Finally, exploratory multi-locus analyses in the complement and coagulation pathway were performed and revealed a potentially significant interaction between a marker in FV (rs2187952) and FVII (rs3211719) (p<0.001).

This study describes the phenotypic diversity in a cohort of 98 affected males from 56 families with RPGR mutations, and demonstrates the contribution of genetic factors (i.e., allelic heterogeneity and genetic modifiers) to this diversity. Patients were categorized as grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) according to specific clinical criteria. Patient DNAs were genotyped for coding SNPs in 4 candidate modifier genes with products known to interact with RPGR protein: RPGRIP1, RPGRIP1L, CEP290, and IQCB1. Family-based association testing was performed using PLINK. A wide range of clinical severity was observed both between and within families. Patients with mutations in exons 1-14 were more severely affected than those with ORF15 mutations, and patients with predicted null alleles were more severely affected than those predicted to make RPGR protein. Two SNPs showed association with severe disease: the minor allele (N) of I393N in IQCB1 (p\u200a=\u200a0.044) and the common allele (R) of R744Q in RPGRIP1L (p\u200a=\u200a0.049).

The extent to which mutations of the HH pathway genes are involved in the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma (MMe) is unknown.\nReal-time PCR analysis of HH pathway genes PTCH1, GLI1 and GLI2 were performed on 7 human MMe cell lines. Exon sequencing of 13 HH pathway genes was also performed in cell lines and human MMe tumors. In silico programs were used to predict the likelihood that an amino-acid substitution would have a functional effect. GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1 were highly expressed in MMe cells, indicative of active HH signaling. PTCH1, SMO and SUFU mutations were found in 2 of 11 MMe cell lines examined. A non-synonymous missense SUFU mutation (p.T411M) was identified in LO68 cells. In silico characterization of the SUFU mutant suggested that the p.T411M mutation might alter protein function. However, we were unable to demonstrate any functional effect of this mutation on Gli activity. Deletion of exons of the PTCH1 gene was found in JU77 cells, resulting in loss of one of two extracellular loops implicated in HH ligand binding and the intracellular C-terminal domain. A 3-bp insertion (69_70insCTG) in SMO, predicting an additional leucine residue in the signal peptide segment of SMO protein was also identified in LO68 cells and a MMe tumour.\nWe identified the first novel mutations in PTCH1, SUFU and SMO associated with MMe. Although HH pathway mutations are relatively rare in MMe, these data suggest a possible role for dysfunctional HH pathway in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of MMe and help rationalize the exploration of HH pathway inhibitors for MMe therapy."}

We hypothesize that disruption of miRNA target binding by SNPs is a widespread mechanism relevant to cancer susceptibility. To test this, we analyzed SNPs known to be associated with BC risk, in silico and in vitro, for their ability to modify miRNA binding sites and miRNA gene regulation and referred to these as target SNPs. We identified rs1982073-TGFB1 and rs1799782-XRCC1 as target SNPs, whose alleles could modulate gene expression by differential interaction with miR-187 and miR-138, respectively. Genome-wide bioinformatics analysis predicted approximately 64% of transcribed SNPs as target SNPs that can modify (increase/decrease) the binding energy of putative miRNA::mRNA duplexes by >90%. To assess whether target SNPs are implicated in BC susceptibility, we conducted a case-control population study and observed that germline occurrence of rs799917-BRCA1 and rs334348-TGFR1 significantly varies among populations with different risks of developing BC. Luciferase activity of target SNPs, allelic variants, and protein levels in cancer cell lines with different genotypes showed differential regulation of target genes following overexpression of the two interacting miRNAs (miR-638 and miR-628-5p). Therefore, we propose that transcribed target SNPs alter miRNA gene regulation and, consequently, protein expression, contributing to the likelihood of cancer susceptibility, by a novel mechanism of subtle gene regulation."}

Using a bioinformatic screen for ciliary genes in combination with mutational analyses, we identified ARL6 as the gene underlying Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3, a multisystemic disorder characterized by obesity, blindness, polydactyly, renal abnormalities and cognitive impairment. We uncovered four different homozygous substitutions in ARL6 in four unrelated families affected with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, two of which disrupt a threonine residue important for GTP binding and function of several related small GTP-binding proteins. Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans ARL6 homolog indicates that it is specifically expressed in ciliated cells, and that, in addition to the postulated cytoplasmic functions of ARL proteins, it undergoes intraflagellar transport.

In this hospital-based case-control study with 696 white patients newly diagnosed with bladder cancer and 629 unaffected white controls, we applied a multigenic approach to examine the associations with bladder cancer risk of a comprehensive panel of 44 selected polymorphisms in two pathways, DNA repair and cell-cycle control, and to evaluate higher-order gene-gene interactions, using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. Individually, only XPD Asp312Asn, RAG1 Lys820Arg, and a p53 intronic SNP exhibited statistically significant main effects. However, we found a significant gene-dosage effect for increasing numbers of potential high-risk alleles in DNA-repair and cell-cycle pathways separately and combined. For the nucleotide-excision repair pathway, compared with the referent group (fewer than four adverse alleles), individuals with four (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.20), five to six (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.31-2.50), and seven or more adverse alleles (OR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.69-3.70) had increasingly elevated risks of bladder cancer (P for trend <.001). Each additional adverse allele was associated with a 1.21-fold increase in risk (95% CI 1.12-1.29). For the combined analysis of DNA-repair and cell-cycle SNPs, compared with the referent group (<13 adverse alleles), the ORs for individuals with 13-15, 16-17, and >or=18 adverse alleles were 1.22 (95% CI 0.84-1.76), 1.57 (95% CI 1.05-2.35), and 1.77 (95% CI 1.19-2.63), respectively (P for trend = .002). Each additional high-risk allele was associated with a 1.07-fold significant increase in risk. In addition, we found that smoking had a significant multiplicative interaction with SNPs in the combined DNA-repair and cell-cycle-control pathways (P<.01). All genetic effects were evident only in \"ever smokers\" (persons who had smoked >or=100 cigarettes) and not in \"never smokers.\" A cross-validation statistical method developed in this study confirmed the above observations. CART analysis revealed potential higher-order gene-gene and gene-smoking interactions and categorized a few higher-risk subgroups for bladder cancer. Moreover, subgroups identified with higher cancer risk also exhibited higher levels of induced genetic damage than did subgroups with lower risk. There was a significant trend of higher numbers of bleomycin- and benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE)-induced chromatid breaks (by mutagen-sensitivity assay) and DNA damage (by comet assay) for individuals in higher-risk subgroups among cases of bladder cancer in smokers. The P for the trend was .0348 for bleomycin-induced chromosome breaks, .0036 for BPDE-induced chromosome breaks, and .0397 for BPDE-induced DNA damage, indicating that these higher-order gene-gene and gene-smoking interactions included SNPs that modulated repair and resulted in diminished DNA-repair capacity. Thus, genotype/phenotype analyses support findings from CART analyses. This is the first comprehensive study to use a multigenic analysis for bladder cancer, and the data suggest that individuals with a higher number of genetic variations in DNA-repair and cell-cycle-control genes are at an increased risk for bladder cancer, confirming the importance of taking a multigenic pathway-based approach to risk assessment."}

Since the original report of 2003, eight replication attempts have been published reporting discordant results. As the dyslexia community still considers the role of DYX1C1 unsettled, we explored the contribution of this gene in a sample of 366 trios of German descent.\nTo the common four markers used in previous studies, we added two new single nucleotide polymorphisms found by resequencing both the putative regulatory and coding region of the gene in randomly selected cases and controls. As linkage disequilibrium blocks of the region were not easy to define, we approached the association problem by running a transmission disequilibrium test over sliding windows of dimension 1 to 6 on consecutive markers. The significance of this test was calculated generating the empirical distribution of the global P value by simulating the data. As our study sample had a large female proband content, we also stratified our analysis by sex.\nWe found statistically significant association with global corrected P value of 0.036. The three-marker haplotype G/G/G spanning rs3743205/rs3743204/rs600753 was most associated with a P value of 0.006 and odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-9.6) in female probands. A detailed haplotype-phenotype analysis revealed that the dyslexia subphenotype short-term memory contributed mainly to the observed findings. This is in accordance with a recent short-term memory-DYX1C1 association in an independent sample of dyslexia.\nAs significant association was proved in our sample, we could also conclude that denser maps, sex information, and well-defined subphenotypes are crucial to correctly determine the contribution of DYX1C1 to dyslexia."}

Gene-environment (G\u00d7E) interaction is considered pivotal in determining trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders. Regression-based methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response and the genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction is the commonly used approach in detecting G\u00d7E interaction. The linearity assumption, however, could be easily violated due to non-linear genetic penetrance which induces non-linear G\u00d7E interaction.\nIn this work, we propose to relax the linear G\u00d7E assumption and allow for non-linear G\u00d7E interaction under a varying coefficient model framework. We propose to estimate the varying coefficients with regression spline technique. The model allows one to assess the non-linear penetrance of a genetic variant under different environmental stimuli, therefore help us to gain novel insights into the etiology of a complex disease. Several statistical tests are proposed for a complete dissection of G\u00d7E interaction. A wild bootstrap method is adopted to assess the statistical significance. Both simulation and real data analysis demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed method. Our method provides a powerful and testable framework for assessing non-linear G\u00d7E interaction."}

Loss-of-function mutations in the LEKTI encoding gene SPINK5 cause Netherton syndrome, a rare and severe genetic skin disease with a profound skin barrier defect and atopic manifestations. Several studies also reported genetic association between the multifactorial disease atopic dermatitis (AD) and a frequent and non-conservative LEKTI variant, E420K, in different populations. Here, we provide evidence that the 420K variant impacts on LEKTI function by increasing the likelihood of furin-dependent LEKTI precursor cleavage within the linker region D6-D7. This results in the reversal of the cleavage priorities for LEKTI proteolytic activation and prevents the formation of the LEKTI fragment D6D9 known to display the strongest inhibitory activity against kallikrein (KLK) 5-mediated desmoglein-1 (DSG1) degradation. Using in situ and gel zymographies, we show that the modification of the subtle balance in LEKTI inhibitory fragments leads to enhanced KLK5, KLK7 and elastase-2 (ELA-2) activities in 420KK epidermis. By immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses, we found that increased epidermal protease activity correlates with reduced DSG1 protein expression and accelerated profilaggrin proteolysis. All changes determined by the presence of residue 420K within the LEKTI sequence likely contribute to defective skin barrier permeability. Remarkably, LEKTI 420KK epidermis displays an increased expression of the proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This is the first functional evidence supporting association studies which identified the 420K LEKTI variant as a predisposing factor to AD, in combination with other genetic and environmental factors."}

This SNP has also been shown to have an association with decreased risk in breast cancer. There was a suggestion of an association for AURKA, when one study that caused significant study heterogeneity was excluded [ordinal OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.20) p = 0.027; dominant OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.24) p = 0.03]. The other 5 SNPs in BRCA2, CDKN2A, SRD5A2, CASP8 and TGFB1 showed no association with ovarian cancer risk; given the large sample size, these results can also be considered to be informative. These null results for SNPs identified from relatively large initial studies shows the importance of replicating associations by a consortium approach."}

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of diabetes and related traits, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG). However, the majority of GWASs have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. Thus, it is important to conduct replication analyses in populations with non-European ancestry to identify shared loci associated with FPG across populations.\nWe used data collected from non-diabetic unrelated African-American individuals (n = 927) who participated in the Howard University Family Study to attempt to replicate previously published GWASs of FPG. Of the 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported, we directly tested 20 in this study. In addition to the direct test, we queried a 500 kb window centred on all 29 reported SNPs for local replication of additional markers in linkage disequilibrium (LD).\nUsing direct SNP and LD-based comparisons, we replicated multiple SNPs previously associated with FPG and strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in populations with European ancestry. The replicated SNPs included those in or near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, G6PC2, MTNR1B, DGKB-TMEM195 and GCKR. We also replicated additional variants in LD with the reported SNPs in ZMAT4 and adjacent to IRS1.\nWe identified multiple GWAS variants for FPG in our cohort of African-Americans. Using an LD-based strategy we also identified SNPs not previously reported, demonstrating the utility of using diverse populations for replication analysis."}

No alteration was found in any of the pancreatic cancers examined, but three mutations were identified in hepatocellular carcinomas; one was a 6-bp somatic deletion within intron 6. The other two mutations we identified in hepatocellular carcinomas were missense mutations in the germ line, although all BRCA2 mutations thus far detected in patients with familial breast cancers likewise have been deletions. None of 194 other patients with cancers or 44 normal controls exhibited either mutation. Combined with our demonstration of BRCA2 expression in adult liver tissue, the evidence implies that inactivation of BRCA2 may play some role in development or progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and might predispose carriers of mutant alleles to liver malignancies."}

Genotypes were determined in DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 265 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well as 280 cancer-free controls by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We found an association between HNSCC and the Ser326Cys (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.19-2.45) as well as Cys326Cys (OR 4.56; 95% CI 2.07-10.05) variants of the OGG1 gene. The gene-gene interaction between MUTYH and OGG1 as well as OGG1 and XPD polymorphic variants may contribute to higher prevalence of HNSCC. We also found an association between Ser326Cys and Cys326Cys variants of OGG1 gene and smoking status in HNSCC patients (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.25-3.11), (OR 3.54; 95% CI 1.39-9.04), respectively. Moreover, we also observed a protective association between Tyr165Cys variant of the MUTYH gene and non-smoking status in HNSCC (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.17-0.66). We also found a link between gene-gene interaction (MUTYH and OGG1 or OGG1 and XPD) and smoking (ORs 2.17-4.20 and 2.18-5.23) or non-smoking status (ORs 0.11 and 7.61) in HNSCC patients, respectively.

The issue of secondary (so-called incidental) findings in exome analysis is controversial, and data are needed on methods of detection and their frequency. We piloted secondary variant detection by analyzing exomes for mutations in cancer-susceptibility syndromes in subjects ascertained for atherosclerosis phenotypes. We performed exome sequencing on 572 ClinSeq participants, and in 37 genes, we interpreted variants that cause high-penetrance cancer syndromes by using an algorithm that filtered results on the basis of mutation type, quality, and frequency and that filtered mutation-database entries on the basis of defined categories of causation. We identified 454 sequence variants that differed from the human reference. Exclusions were made on the basis of sequence quality (26 variants) and high frequency in the cohort (77 variants) or dbSNP (17 variants), leaving 334 variants of potential clinical importance. These were further filtered on the basis of curation of literature reports. Seven participants, four of whom were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and three of whom did not meet family-history-based referral criteria, had deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. One participant had a deleterious SDHC mutation, which causes paragangliomas. Exome sequencing, coupled with multidisciplinary interpretation, detected clinically important mutations in cancer-susceptibility genes; four of such mutations were in individuals without a significant family history of disease. We conclude that secondary variants of high clinical importance will be detected at an appreciable frequency in exomes, and we suggest that priority be given to the development of more efficient modes of interpretation with trials in larger patient groups."}

Among the four genes, however, only PTPRCAP expression was affected by haplotypes of the 10 SNPs. Endogenous transcript levels of PTPRCAP were linearly correlated with copy numbers (0, 1, and 2) of the risk-haplotype (P = .0060) in 12 lymphoblastoid cells derived from blood samples, but those of the other three genes were not. Furthermore, the cancer-risk, minor-allele T of rs869736 increased both promoter activity and specific nuclear protein-binding affinity than the nonrisk, major-allele G in luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, respectively. Accordingly, the minor allele of rs869736 in the PTPRCAP promoter is associated with increased susceptibility to diffuse-type gastric cancer by increasing PTPRCAP expression, possibly leading to activation of the oncogenic Src family kinases."}

In parallel, we tested them by using functional splicing assays. A total of 10 VUSs were predicted by two or more programs to induce a significant reduction of splice site strength or activation of cryptic splice sites or generation of new splice sites.

We predict approximately 1,500 nsSNPs affect protein function and these tend be heterozygous, rare, or novel. Of the approximately 700 coding indels, approximately half tend to have lengths that are a multiple of three, which causes insertions/deletions of amino acids in the corresponding protein, rather than introducing frameshifts. Coding indels also occur frequently at the termini of genes, so even if an indel causes a frameshift, an alternative start or stop site in the gene can still be used to make a functional protein. In summary, we reduced the set of approximately 12,500 nonsilent coding variants by approximately 8-fold to a set of variants that are most likely to have major effects on their proteins' functions. This is our first glimpse of an individual's exome and a snapshot of the current state of personalized genomics. The majority of coding variants in this individual are common and appear to be functionally neutral. Our results also indicate that some variants can be used to improve the current NCBI human reference genome. As more genomes are sequenced, many rare variants and non-SNP variants will be discovered. We present an approach to analyze the coding variation in humans by proposing multiple bioinformatic methods to hone in on possible functional variation."}

The authors of this report identified predictive factors for mutations in the breast cancer-susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in women who were diagnosed with DCIS.\nOne hundred eighteen women with DCIS who were referred for genetic counseling and underwent genetic testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations between 2003 and 2010 were included in the study. Logistic regression models were fit to determine the associations between potential predictive factors and BRCA status.\nOf 118 high-risk women with DCIS, 27% (n = 32) tested positive for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Of those, 10% (n = 12) and 17% (n = 20) had BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively. Age, race, and tumor characteristics did not differ between BRCA noncarriers and carriers. In a multivariate logistic model, \u22652 relatives with ovarian cancer (OC) (odds ratio [OR], 8.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-56.29; P = .034), and a score \u226510% according to the BRCAPRO mathematical model for calculating the probability that a particular family member carries a germline BRCA mutation (OR, 6.37; 95% CI, 2.23-18.22; P = .0005) remained as independent significant predictors for a BRCA mutation. Fifty-seven percent of mutation carriers but only 25% of noncarriers underwent prophylactic mastectomy(P = .0037). This difference remained significant for patients aged \u226440 years (P = .025).\nWomen who had DCIS and a family history of OC or who had BRCAPRO scores \u226510% had a high rate of BRCA positivity regardless of age at diagnosis. These findings suggest that high-risk patients with DCIS are appropriate candidates for genetic testing for BRCA mutations in the presence of predictive factors even if they do not have invasive breast cancer."}

The aim of this study was to determine whether FLG variants can serve as a predictor for atopic diseases in Korean individuals.\nA total of 648 subjects were genotyped for the FLG P478S (rs11584340, C/T base change) polymorphism (322 patients and 326 controls). Serum levels of free fatty acids (FFA) and IgE were later stratified to determine the effects of the FLG polymorphism on AD.\nA significant difference in genotype frequency was found between AD patients and controls in the FLG P478S polymorphism. The FLG P478S T allele carrier (TT+TC) was associated with AD risk (odds ratio = 1.877, 95% confidence interval 1.089 to 3.234). In addition, the P478S T allele was related to high levels of FFA in AD patients (471.79 \u00b1 298.96 vs. 333.54 \u00b1 175.82 \u03bcg eq/l, P <0.05).\nThe results of the present study suggest that the FLG P478S polymorphism alone and combined with other factors influences FFA levels and increases the susceptibility to AD."}

The association was not attributable to bone mineral density, which suggests that polymorphism influences some aspects of bone quality that affects strength and/or frailty rather than bone strength itself. Thus, we examined the relationship between genetic polymorphism and lean body mass in a Japanese population.\nA total of 479 adults comprising 143 men and 336 women, age 23 to 85 years, participated in the present study. Fat-free mass was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the relative skeletal muscle index was calculated as the ratio of appendicular (sum of arms and legs) fat-free mass to the square of height.\nTotal, leg, and appendicular fat-free mass as well as the relative skeletal muscle index were significantly lower in male subjects with CT/TT genotypes compared to those with CC genotype.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between polymorphisms in ERCC2, ERCC1 and XRCC1 genes and survival of non-smoking female patients with lung adenocarcinoma.\nWe used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method to evaluate SNPs in ERCC2, ERCC1 and XRCC1 genes among 257 patients.\nThe overall median survival time (MST) was 13.07 months. Increasing numbers of either ERCC1 118 or XRCC1 399 variant alleles were associated with shorter survival of non-smoking female lung adenocarcinoma patients (Log-rank P < 0.001). The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for individuals with CT or TT genotype at ERCC1 Asn118Asn were 1.48 and 2.67 compared with those with CC genotype. For polymorphism of XRCC1 399, the HRs were 1.28 and 2.68 for GA and AA genotype. When variant alleles across both polymorphisms were combined to analysis, the increasing number of variant alleles was associated with decreasing overall survival.

We found significant variation across categories of conditions in the percentage of expected associations that we were able to replicate, which may reflect systematic inflation of the effects in some initial reports, or differences across diseases in the likelihood of misdiagnosis or misreport. We also demonstrated that we could improve replication success by taking advantage of our recontactable cohort, offering more in-depth questions to refine self-reported diagnoses. Our data suggest that online collection of self-reported data from a recontactable cohort may be a viable method for both broad and deep phenotyping in large populations."}

The primary risk factors, gastro-esophageal acid reflux and smoking, are potentially genotoxic through the generation of N-nitroso compounds. The DNA repair protein O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the major cellular defense against alkylating DNA damage. We compared patients with EAC (n = 263) or EGJAC (n = 303) with matched population controls (n = 1,337) for the frequency of 5 MGMT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12269324, rs12268840, L84F, I143V, K178R), as well as SNPs in DNA repair genes ERCC1 (N118N), XRCC1 (Q399R) and XPD (K751Q). Relative risks were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Potential biological interaction was assessed through the synergy index S. Each MGMT SNP conferred increased risks of EAC but not EGJAC; strongest associations were found for the 2 variant MGMT alleles rs12268840 and I143V (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). Homozygous carriers of MGMT rs12268840 with frequent acid reflux had significantly higher risks of EAC (OR 15.5, 95% CI 5.8-42) than expected under an additive model, consistent with biological interaction (S = 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-10). Modest, nonsignificant interactions with smoking were also observed. Homozygous variant ERCC1 genotype was associated with reduced risks of EAC (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.1), while the homozygous variant XRCC1 genotype conferred higher risks of EGJAC (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4). No associations with EAC or EGJAC were observed with XPD (rs13181). In summary, MGMT SNPs are associated with increased risks of EAC.

However there is considerable debate on the relevance of ethnic background in clinical genetics, reflecting both the significance and complexity of genetic heritage. We address this via a systematic review of reported associations with cancer risk for 82 markers in 68 studies across six different cancer types, comparing association results between ethnic groups and examining linkage disequilibrium between risk alleles and nearby genetic loci. We find that the relevance of ethnic background depends on the question. If asked whether the association of variants with disease risk is conserved across ethnic boundaries, we find that the answer is yes, the majority of markers show insignificant variability in association with cancer risk across ethnic groups. However if the question is whether a significant association between a variant and cancer risk is likely to reproduce, the answer is no, most markers do not validate in an ethnic group other than the discovery cohort's ancestry. This lack of reproducibility is not attributable to studies being inadequately populated due to low allele frequency in other ethnic groups. Instead, differences in local genomic structure between ethnic groups are associated with the strength of association with cancer risk and therefore confound interpretation of the implied physiologic association tracked by the disease allele. This suggest that a biological association for cancer risk alleles may be broadly consistent across ethnic boundaries, but reproduction of a clinical study in another ethnic group is uncommon, in part due to confounding genomic architecture. As clinical studies are increasingly performed globally this has important implications for how cancer risk stratifiers should be studied and employed."}

It was placed on the \"fast track\" to address the preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality assurance practices of laboratories currently providing testing for CF. Due to the anticipated impact of the ACMG recommendation statement endorsing carrier testing of reproductive couples, it was viewed that CF testing would increase in volume and that the number of laboratories offering CF testing would also likely increase. Therefore, this document was drafted with the premise of providing useful information gained by experienced laboratory directors who have provided such testing for many years. In many instances, \"tips\" are given. However, these guidelines are not to be interpreted as restrictive or the only approach but to provide a helpful guide. Certainly, appropriately trained and credentialed laboratory directors have flexibility to utilize various testing platforms and design testing strategies with considerable latitude. We felt that it was essential to include technique-specific guidelines of several current technologies commonly used in laboratories providing CF testing, since three of the four technologies discussed are available commercially and are widely utilized. We take the view that these technologies will change, and thus this document will change with future review."}

In a recent report, mutations in NOTCH1 a signaling and transcriptional regulator have been shown to cause BAV in two families. This study provides data on systematic sequencing in search for novel mutations in NOTCH1 gene in a large sample BAV. For the first time, we report results of a systematic mutation-analysis based on DNA-sequencing of all coding exons and adjacent splice consensus sequences of NOTCH1 gene. Our analyses revealed 57 NOTCH1 sequence variants. Twenty-one variants are located within exons and 36 within intronic or 5'-UTR sequences. Thirty-five variants were described previously as polymorphisms. The remaining 22, however, were neither listed in public SNP databases nor in the literature and were therefore considered novel. Seventeen variants were found only once (MAF = 1%), of these 15 were novel. Two sequence variants led to amino acid substitutions (p.T596M and p.P1797H) and are located in highly conserved regions of the NOTCH1 protein. In addition, these two mutations could not be detected in at least 327 healthy controls by using RFLP-analysis. The functional relevance of the other 13 novel and rare variants could not be proven without further functional examination. In this study, we provide a new evidence that the mutations in the NOTCH1 gene may trigger the underlying mechanism causing the valve calcification, especially in BAV. In conclusion, NOTCH1 gene mutations do not only play a role in familiar BAV, but can also be observed in approximately 4% of sporadic cases."}

Although the role of intermediate filament genes, including KRT1, in wound activated keratinocytes is well established, this is the first study to examine if genetic variants in humans contribute to differences in the migration rates of these cells. Using an in vitro scratch wound assay we observe quantifiable variation in HEK migration rates in two independent sets of samples; 24 samples in the first set and 17 samples in the second set. We analyze genetic variants in the KRT1 interval and identify SNPs significantly associated with HEK migration rates in both samples sets. Additionally, we show in the first set of samples that the average migration rate of HEK cells homozygous for one common haplotype pattern in the KRT1 interval is significantly faster than that of HEK cells homozygous for a second common haplotype pattern. Our study demonstrates that genetic variants in the KRT1 interval contribute to quantifiable differences in the migration rates of keratinocytes isolated from different individuals. Furthermore we show that in vitro cell assays can successfully be used to deconstruct complex traits into simple biological model systems for genetic association studies."}

We sought to investigate whether CNVs may modulate risk for ischemic stroke (IS) and to provide a catalog of CNVs in patients with this disorder by analyzing copy number metrics produced as a part of our previous genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association study of ischemic stroke in a North American white population. We examined CNVs in 263 patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Each identified CNV was compared with changes identified in 275 neurologically normal controls. Our analysis identified 247 CNVs, corresponding to 187 insertions (76%; 135 heterozygous; 25 homozygous duplications or triplications; 2 heterosomic) and 60 deletions (24%; 40 heterozygous deletions; 3 homozygous deletions; 14 heterosomic deletions). Most alterations (81%) were the same as, or overlapped with, previously reported CNVs. We report here the first genome-wide analysis of CNVs in IS patients. In summary, our study did not detect any common genomic structural variation unequivocally linked to IS, although we cannot exclude that smaller CNVs or CNVs in genomic regions poorly covered by this methodology may confer risk for IS. The application of genome-wide SNP arrays now facilitates the evaluation of structural changes through the entire genome as part of a genome-wide genetic association study."}

However, while classification of protein-truncating mutations as deleterious is relatively straightforward, distinguishing as deleterious or neutral the large number of rare missense variants is a difficult on-going task. In this article, we present one approach to this problem, hierarchical statistical modeling of data observed in a case-control study of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in which all the participants were genotyped for variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Hierarchical modeling permits leverage of information from observed correlations of characteristics of groups of variants with case-control status to infer with greater precision the risks of individual rare variants. A total of 181 distinct rare missense variants were identified among the 705 cases with CBC and the 1,398 controls with unilateral breast cancer. The model identified three bioinformatic hierarchical covariates, align-GV, align-GD, and SIFT scores, each of which was modestly associated with risk. Collectively, the 11 variants that were classified as adverse on the basis of all the three bioinformatic predictors demonstrated a stronger risk signal. This group included five of six missense variants that were classified as deleterious at the outset by conventional criteria. The remaining six variants can be considered as plausibly deleterious, and deserving of further investigation (BRCA1 R866C; BRCA2 G1529R, D2665G, W2626C, E2663V, and R3052W). Hierarchical modeling is a strategy that has promise for interpreting the evidence from future association studies that involve sequencing of known or suspected cancer genes."}

The study included 411 cases with biliary tract cancer (237 gallbladder, 127 extrahepatic bile duct, and 47 ampulla of Vater), 895 with biliary stones, and 786 controls randomly selected from the population. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association of individual SNPs and haplotypes with biliary stones and biliary tract cancer. Of the 62 SNPs examined, 14 were related to the risk of biliary cancer and stones. Specifically, variants in the IL8, IL8RB, RNASEL, and NOS2 genes were associated with biliary stones, whereas VEGF variants were associated with gallbladder cancer. Of the 10 genes with multiple SNPs from which we inferred haplotypes, only one IL8RB haplotype, consisting of 3 SNPs (rs2230054, rs1126579, and rs1126580), was associated with the risk of bile duct cancer (P = 0.003) and biliary stones (P = 0.02), relative to the most frequent haplotype.

Here the role of NMDARs in MS was first explored in 691 subjects carrying specific allelic variants of the NR1 subunit gene or of the NR2B subunit gene of this glutamate receptor. The analysis was replicated for significant SNPs in an independent sample of 1548 MS subjects. The C allele of rs4880213 was found to be associated with reduced NMDAR-mediated cortical excitability, and with increased probability of having more disability than the CT/TT MS subjects. MS severity was higher in the CC group among relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) patients, while primary progressive MS (PP-MS) subjects homozygous for the T allele had more pronounced clinical worsening. Mean time to first relapse, but not to an active MRI scan, was lower in the CC group of RR-MS patients, and the number of subjects with two or more clinical relapses in the first two years of the disease was higher in CC compared to CT/TT group. Furthermore, the percentage of relapses associated with residual disability was lower in subjects carrying the T allele. Lesion load at the MRI was conversely unaffected by the C or T allele of this SNP in RR-MS patients. Axonal and neuronal degeneration at the optical coherence tomography was more severe in the TT group of PP-MS patients, while reduced retinal nerve fiber thickness had less consequences on visual acuity in RR-MS patients bearing the T allele. Finally, the T allele was associated with preserved cognitive abilities at the Rao's brief repeatable neuropsychological battery in RR-MS. Signaling through glutamate NMDARs enhances both compensatory synaptic plasticity and excitotoxic neurodegeneration, impacting in opposite ways on RR-MS and PP-MS pathophysiological mechanisms."}

Altogether 66 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 candidate genes were genotyped.\nWith logistic regression, we identified 6 SNPs in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes associated with increased risk to B-cell ALL, and two SNPs in the STAT3 gene, which decreased the risk to hyperdiploid ALL. Because the associated SNPs were in linkage in each gene, these associations corresponded to one signal per gene. The odds ratio (OR) associated with the tag SNPs were: OR = 1.69, P = 2.22x10(-7) for rs4132601 (IKZF1), OR = 1.53, P = 1.95x10(-5) for rs10821936 (ARID5B) and OR = 0.64, P = 2.32x10(-4) for rs12949918 (STAT3). With the BN-BMLA we confirmed the findings of the frequentist-based method and received additional information about the nature of the relations between the SNPs and the disease. E.g. the rs10821936 in ARID5B and rs17405722 in STAT3 showed a weak interaction, and in case of T-cell lineage sample group, the gender showed a weak interaction with three SNPs in three genes. In the hyperdiploid patient group the BN-BMLA detected a strong interaction among SNPs in the NOTCH1, STAT1, STAT3 and BCL2 genes. Evaluating the survival rate of the patients with ALL, the BN-BMLA showed that besides risk groups and subtypes, genetic variations in the BAX and CEBPA genes might also influence the probability of survival of the patients.\nIn the present study we confirmed the roles of genetic variations in ARID5B and IKZF1 in the susceptibility to B-cell ALL. With the newly developed BN-BMLA method several gene-gene, gene-phenotype and phenotype-phenotype connections were revealed. We showed several advantageous features of the new method, and suggested that in gene association studies the BN-BMLA might be a useful supplementary to the traditional frequentist-based statistical method."}

The strongest genetic risk factor for MBC is represented by inherited BRCA2 mutations, whereas the association between MBC and BRCA1 mutations is less clear. MBC appears to be biologically similar to breast cancer in females, however the phenotypic characteristics of BRCA1/2-related MBCs are not yet well elucidated.\nTo investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of MBC in a large and well-characterized population-based series of 108 MBCs from Tuscany (Central Italy) and to evaluate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status and clinical-pathological features including breast/ovarian cancer first-degree family history, tumor histology and grade, proliferative activity, estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Results BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were identified in ten MBCs, in particular, two cases (1.9%) carried BRCA1 and eight cases (7.4%) carried BRCA2 mutations. The same BRCA1 mutation (3347delAG) was detected in two unrelated MBC cases. Three novel BRCA2 pathogenic mutations were found. Statistically significant associations emerged between BRCA2-related tumors and absence of PR expression (P = 0.008), HER2 over-expression (P = 0.002) and high tumor grade (P = 0.005). Conclusions Here, we (i) reported that in our population about 9% of MBC cases are accounted for by BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations; (ii) enlarged the BRCA2 mutational spectrum and (iii) characterized a specific phenotype associated with BRCA2-related MBCs suggestive of aggressive behavior.

Patients with moderate to severe fibrosis (radiosensitive cases, G2-3, n = 30) were matched and compared to those with little or no reaction (controls, G0-1, n = 30). The three nonsynonymous SNPs were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing. Significant association was observed for TGFB1 T869C and XRCC1 G28152A genotypes (P < or = 0.05). Both variant alleles, TGFB1 869C and XRCC1 28152A, were associated with a lower grade of fibrosis (odds ratios were 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20-0.86, P = 0.02 and 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.89, P = 0.02, respectively), and therefore the wild-types were the risk alleles. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the median number of risk alleles between the radiosensitive and the control groups (P = 0.006). We conclude that radiotherapy complications are associated with genetic variations in our nasopharynx cancer patients. Our findings support the assumption of the combined effects of multiple SNPs. Large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings before polymorphisms can be used as predictive markers to individualize radiation therapy on genetic bases."}

In addition, families without mutations identified were further screened with STR markers around these 13 known LCA genes and two loci.\nDisease-causing mutations were identified in nine of the 37 families: five in TULP1, two in CRB1, one in RPE65, and one in GUCY2D. Mutations in known genes only accounted for 24% of the Saudi families--much less than what has been observed in the European population (65%). Phenotype-genotype analysis was carried out to investigate the LCA disease penetrance for all families whose mutations identified. All identified mutations were found to segregate perfectly with the disease phenotype. On the other hand, severity of the disease varies for different patients carrying the same mutation and even within the same family. Furthermore, based on homozygosity mapping with both STR and SNP markers, one family is likely to map to the LCA3 locus.\nThese results underscore the importance of studying LCA disease families from different ethnic backgrounds to identify additional novel LCA disease genes. Furthermore, perfect segregation between mutation and disease indicates that LCA is fully penetrant. However, phenotypic variations among patients carrying the same mutation suggest that at least some of the variations in the clinical phenotype is due to modification from the genetic background, environment, or other factors."}

In addition, haplotype analysis for seven selected SNPs did not reveal a difference for the SLE patient groups with and without nephritis. Moreover, none of these SPNs showed a significant difference between IgAN patients and healthy controls. IRF5 and STAT4 variants remained significantly different between SLE cases and healthy controls.

In higher eukaryotes, alternative splicing is a prevalent mechanism for generating transcriptome and proteome diversity. Alternative splicing can modulate gene function, affect organismal phenotype and cause disease. Common genetic variation that affects splicing regulation can lead to differences in alternative splicing between human individuals and consequently impact expression level or protein function. In several well-documented examples, such natural variation of alternative splicing has indeed been shown to influence disease susceptibility and drug response. With new microarray and sequencing-based genomic technologies that can analyze eukaryotic transcriptomes at the exon or nucleotide level, it has become possible to globally compare the alternative splicing profiles across human individuals in any tissue or cell type of interest. Recent large-scale transcriptome studies using high-density splicing-sensitive microarray and deep RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) have revealed widespread genetic variation of alternative splicing in humans. In the future, an extensive catalog of alternative splicing variation in human populations will help elucidate the molecular underpinnings of complex traits and human diseases, and shed light on the mechanisms of splicing regulation in human cells."}

RAI1 (Retinoic Acid Induced 1) is recognized as a major gene involved in the SMS phenotype. Extensive genetic and clinical analyses of 36 patients with SMS-like features, but without the 17p11.2 microdeletion, yielded 10 patients with RAI1 variants, including 4 with de novo deleterious mutations, and 6 with novel missense variants, 5 of which were familial. Haplotype analysis showed two major RAI1 haplotypes in our primarily Caucasian cohort; the novel RAI1 variants did not occur in a preferred haplotype. RNA analysis revealed that RAI1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in cells of patients with the common 17p11.2 deletion, as well as in those with de novo RAI1 variants. Expression levels varied in patients with familial RAI1 variants and in non-17p11.2 deleted patients without identified RAI1 defects. No correlation between SNP haplotype and RAI1 expression was found. Two clinical features, ocular abnormalities and polyembolokoilomania (object insertion), were significantly correlated with decreased RAI1 expression. While not significantly correlated, the presence of hearing loss, seizures, hoarse voice, childhood onset of obesity and specific behavioral aspects and the absence of immunologic abnormalities and cardiovascular or renal structural anomalies, appeared to be specific for the de novo RAI1 subgroup. Recognition of the combination of these features will assist in referral for RAI1 analysis of patients with SMS-like features without detectable microdeletion of 17p11.2. Moreover, RAI1 expression emerged as a genetic target for development of therapeutic interventions for SMS."}

In summary, we showed for the first time that both the XPD polymorphic variants and the decreased level of its expression might be associated with aging."}

Mutations in the Arf/Arl-family GTPase Arl6 have been recently shown to be responsible for BBS type 3. Here we show that BBS mutations alter the guanine nucleotide-binding properties of Arl6. Specifically, substitution of 31st Threonine to Arginine selectively abrogates the GTP-binding ability of Arl6 without affecting GDP-binding/dissociating properties. Furthermore, all the BBS mutations in Arl6 result in low expression of the mutant proteins, which can be restored by the inhibition of the proteasome. These findings implicate that Arl6 mutants are destabilized and eliminated by the proteasome in cells, probably due to the altered nucleotide-binding properties."}

Genet.: 84(5), 664-71.", "authors": "Ali M et al.", "pubmed_id": 19361779, "year": "2009", "abstract": "Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by high intraocular pressure (IOP), usually within the first year of life, which potentially could lead to optic nerve damage, globe enlargement, and permanent loss of vision. To date, PCG has been linked to three loci: 2p21 (GLC3A), for which the responsible gene is CYP1B1, and 1p36 (GLC3B) and 14q24 (GLC3C), for which the genes remain to be identified. Here we report that null mutations in LTBP2 cause PCG in four consanguineous families from Pakistan and in patients of Gypsy ethnicity. LTBP2 maps to chromosome 14q24.3 but is around 1.3 Mb proximal to the documented GLC3C locus. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether LTBP2 is the GLC3C gene or whether a second adjacent gene is also implicated in PCG. LTBP2 is the largest member of the latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta binding protein family, which are extracellular matrix proteins with multidomain structure. It has homology to fibrillins and may have roles in cell adhesion and as a structural component of microfibrils. We confirmed localization of LTBP2 in the anterior segment of the eye, at the ciliary body, and particularly the ciliary process. These findings reveal that LTBP2 is essential for normal development of the anterior chamber of the eye, where it may have a structural role in maintaining ciliary muscle tone."}
{"title": "Low penetrance breast cancer susceptibility loci are associated with specific breast tumor subtypes: findings from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.", "journal": "Hum. Mol. Genet.: 20(16), 3289-303.", "authors": "Broeks A et al.", "pubmed_id": 21596841, "year": "2011", "abstract": "Breast cancers demonstrate substantial biological, clinical and etiological heterogeneity. We investigated breast cancer risk associations of eight susceptibility loci identified in GWAS and two putative susceptibility loci in candidate genes in relation to specific breast tumor subtypes. Subtypes were defined by five markers (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR) and other pathological and clinical features. Analyses included up to 30 040 invasive breast cancer cases and 53 692 controls from 31 studies within the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We confirmed previous reports of stronger associations with ER+ than ER- tumors for six of the eight loci identified in GWAS: rs2981582 (10q26) (P-heterogeneity = 6.1 \u00d7 10(-18)), rs3803662 (16q12) (P = 3.7 \u00d7 10(-5)), rs13281615 (8q24) (P = 0.002), rs13387042 (2q35) (P = 0.006), rs4973768 (3p24) (P = 0.003) and rs6504950 (17q23) (P = 0.002). The two candidate loci, CASP8 (rs1045485, rs17468277) and TGFB1 (rs1982073), were most strongly related with the risk of PR negative tumors (P = 5.1 \u00d7 10(-6) and P = 4.1 \u00d7 10(-4), respectively), as previously suggested. Four of the eight loci identified in GWAS were associated with triple negative tumors (P \u2264 0.016): rs3803662 (16q12), rs889312 (5q11), rs3817198 (11p15) and rs13387042 (2q35); however, only two of them (16q12 and 2q35) were associated with tumors with the core basal phenotype (P \u2264 0.002). These analyses are consistent with different biological origins of breast cancers, and indicate that tumor stratification might help in the identification and characterization of novel risk factors for breast cancer subtypes. This may eventually result in further improvements in prevention, early detection and treatment."}

Here we assess these two parameters for the NCI-60, which is among the richest genomic and pharmacological publicly available cancer cell line databases. Homozygous genetic variants that putatively affect protein function were identified in 1,199 genes (approximately 6% of all genes). Variants that are either enriched or depleted compared to non-cancerous genomes, and thus may be influential in cancer progression and differential drug response were identified for 2,546 genes. Potential gene knockouts are made available. Assessment of cell line response to 19,940 compounds, including 110 FDA-approved drugs, reveals \u224880-fold range in resistance versus sensitivity response across cell lines. 103,422 gene variants were significantly correlated with at least one compound (at p<0.0002). These include genes of known pharmacological importance such as IGF1R, BRAF, RAD52, MTOR, STAT2 and TSC2 as well as a large number of candidate genes such as NOM1, TLL2, and XDH. We introduce two new web-based CellMiner applications that enable exploration of variant-to-compound relationships for a broad range of researchers, especially those without bioinformatics support. The first tool, \"Genetic variant versus drug visualization\", provides a visualization of significant correlations between drug activity-gene variant combinations. Examples are given for the known vemurafenib-BRAF, and novel ifosfamide-RAD52 pairings. The second, \"Genetic variant summation\" allows an assessment of cumulative genetic variations for up to 150 combined genes together; and is designed to identify the variant burden for molecular pathways or functional grouping of genes. An example of its use is provided for the EGFR-ERBB2 pathway gene variant data and the identification of correlated EGFR, ERBB2, MTOR, BRAF, MEK and ERK inhibitors. The new tools are implemented as an updated web-based CellMiner version, for which the present publication serves as a compendium."}

NMDA-receptor 2B (NR2B) is a subunit that confers a high sensitivity to ethanol-induced inhibition. Previously we had reported a lack of association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1806201 in the NR2B gene (GRIN2B) and alcoholism. Shortly thereafter, an association between the polymorphism and early-onset alcoholism has been reported. One aim of the present study was to test whether the association between the GRIN2B polymorphism rs1806201 and early-onset alcoholism can be replicated in a larger sample. Moreover, we hypothesized that another genetic variation within GRIN2B (rs1806191) may have an effect in the etiology of alcoholism or withdrawal-related traits.\nWe extended our original study sample to a size of 377 patients and 464 healthy volunteers and performed a replication study, including the second GRIN2B SNP. Associations between allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of the two polymorphisms and alcoholism as well as with patients' phenotypes were investigated.\nNo associations were found between any of the two polymorphisms, tested individually or as haplotypes, and alcoholism, respectively withdrawal-related traits.\nNeither the analyzed SNPs nor any of their haplotypes likely modify susceptibility to alcohol dependence or withdrawal-related phenotypes."}
