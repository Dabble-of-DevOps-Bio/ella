# Quick classification mode

[[toc]]

Instead of performing a full classification, you may instead choose the Quick classification mode by pressing the `QUICK` button at the top of the variant list in the side bar: 

<div style="text-indent: 4%;"><img src="./img/sidebar_modes_quick.png"></div>

This feature is particularly well suited for workflows with large gene panels and many variants. The Quick classification view gives a summary of the most important information necessary for [marking variants](/manual/evidence-sections.html#mark-as-verified-technical-not-relevant) as `TECHNICAL` or `NOT RELEVANT`, or [classifying](/manual/classification-section.html#set-variant-class) as `CLASS U` or `CLASS 2`, and gives you buttons to perform those actions directly:

<div style="text-indent: 4%;"><img src="./img/quick_classification.png"></div>
<br>

Clicking one of these buttons moves the variant down to the respective section in the sidebar. If applicable, add a comment before moving to the next variant; this will be added to the comment field on the CLASSIFICATION page corresponding to the column header (e.g. ANALYSIS SPECIFIC).

When you are done, and ready to do a more thourough interpretation of any remaining variants, click the `FULL` button at the top of the variant list (see also [Evidence sections](/manual/evidence-sections.html) and [Classification section](/manual/classification-section.html)).
