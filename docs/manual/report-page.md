# Report page: Generate a clinical report

Navigate to the report page using the corrseponding button in the top bar:

<div style="text-indent: 4%;"><img src="./img/nav_report_btn.png"></div>

The report page lets you export variants using using standard naming conventions together with the classification, as well as any comments you added to the REPORT field in the CLASSIFICATION section. NB: Currently, this *must* be done before marking the sample as finalised (see below).

Variants classified as Class (3,) 4 or 5 (depending on confifuration) are automatically added to the report and marked with a `-` sign in the side bar. Not included variants are marked with a `+` sign. If you want to remove or add additional variants, simply click anywhere on the variant in the list.

Once you are satisfied, copy the text generated in the REPORT field to LIMS software. You may also add two types of comments: 

- REPORT COMMENT: For comments relevant for the sample as a whole (including all variants) and how the report was written.

- INDICATION COMMENT: For comments about the patient's indication. Note: Comments about how the indication or phenotype has influenced the analysis should be place in the [ANALYSIS SPECIFIC section](/manual/evidence-sections.html#analysis-specific-analyses-only) on the CLASSIFICATION page.
