## Version 1.11

Release date: 25.06.2020

### Highlights

This release brings an improved gene information popup with editing possibilities, and several changes and improvements to the OVERVIEW page. 

#### User-editable gene information

The [gene information popup](/manual/top-bar.html#gene-information) (click the gene name in the top bar) has been improved, with the possibility to add and edit comments about the gene. This can be used for information that is important for evaluating variants in this gene, and is available for all analyses where the gene is included.  

<div style="text-indent: 4%;">
    <img src="./img/1-11-gene-info.png">
    <br>
    <div style="font-size: 80%;">
        <strong>Figure: </strong>User-editable gene information.
    </div>
    <br>
</div>

If a comment has been added, an `INFO` tag is shown next to the gene name. 

#### New OVERVIEW filter feature

A new [filter feature](/manual/choosing-sample-variant.html#filter-the-overview) was added to the ANALYSES OVERVIEW page to quickly locate subsets of analyses. You can filter by these parameters: 

- Analysis name
- Comment text (e.g. useful with [auto-comments](#custom-overview-sections-replaced-with-auto-comments))
- Date requested (ranges up to current date)
- Show only 
    - HTS/Sanger
    - Priorities Normal/High/Urgent

Any combination of these filters is allowed.

<div style="text-indent: 4%;">
    <img src="./img/1-11-overview-filter.png">
    <br>
    <div style="font-size: 80%;">
        <strong>Figure: </strong>User-editable gene information.
    </div>
    <br>
</div>

Note that the filters do _not_ include finalized analyses. 

#### Custom OVERVIEW sections replaced with auto-comments

This release retires the custom sections on the OVERVIEW page and replaces them with a possibility to [auto-add comments](/manual/choosing-sample-variant.html#optional-auto-comments) (`ALL CLASSIFIED`/`NO VARIANTS`) upon deposit of new analyses to the ELLA database. In addition, the [VARIANTS OVERVIEW](/manual/choosing-sample-variant.html#variants-worklist) page has been limited to manually imported, stand-alone variants or individual variants opened from search, and is now available for all users independent of configuration.
