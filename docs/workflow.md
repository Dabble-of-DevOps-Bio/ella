# Concepts


(Describe how the workflow works with interpretation rounds etc...)

E||a's purpose is to help the users classifying variants. The users will either
classify a **single variant** or several variants belonging togheter in an analysis.
An **analysis** is the set of variants that are found in a patient **sample** using
a **genepanel** as variant filter.
 
E||a uses the concept **workflow** to guide the users the classification process.
The workflows for single variants and analyses are slightly different.

## Workflow
Before a classification is official it must be reviewed by at least one other person.
After the review the the variant or analysis is set to 'Finalized'.
This multistep process is the workflow. Each step or interpretation round..
